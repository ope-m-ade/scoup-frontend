and the consensual qualitative research (CQR) method was employed to analyze the data. Five domains (challenges, identity, values, relationship, and well-being) and seventeen categories emerged. Participants experienced implicit discrimination and cultural barriers. They identified themselves as Koreans and valued family’s well-being as their priority. They made efforts to find meaning and satisfaction by supporting children to become independent adults. Participants were aware of their traditional parenting styles and the intergenerational cultural gap with their children. As first-generation immigrants, Korean immigrant fathers reported a lack of genuine relationships with both Korean Americans and non-Korean Americans outside of their families. Although participants reported freedom from the pressure caused by interdependent Korean culture, they felt homesickness and emptiness without their own valued life goals.

With over a million professionals from Asia entering the US labor market in the past decade, a potential under placement may be both inefficient and discriminatory. We collected data on all newly hired assistant professors of management in research-intensive (R1) universities in the USA between 2010 and 2021. We focus on the quality of the university into which first hires are placed and examine whether first-job placement quality is lower for individuals who were born in East, South and Southeast Asia. We find that the quality and quantity of publication record are positively related to the quality of the placement and that Asian nationals have higher performance. However, Asian nationals are placed at lower-quality universities relative to their peers. Further, Asian nationals require a strong performance signal, in the form of first or second authorship on a publication to narrow the placement gap. Our results are explained by a combination of direct bias against applicants of Asian nationality and a requirement of a higher performance “burden of proof” from these applicants, compared to peers who are non-Asian nationals.","authors":["Karen Z.

Data were collected via an online survey during the Fall 2020 semester, when campuses re-opened after closing in March. Two thirds of faculty perceived the severity of COVID-19 as severe, and their greatest concerns related to preventive behaviors, the possibility of a virus resurgence, and concern for the health of family/friends. The majority reported frequently engaging in COVID-19-preventing behaviors, which was highest among female and older faculty, and those with higher perceived severity and concern for personally contracting the virus. Over half of respondents reported teaching and scholarly activities were negatively impacted by the pandemic; most notable barriers to productivity included anxiety/stress and a distracted home environment. The study adds to the research on university faculty during the pandemic and aligns with research on the adult population.","authors":["Edward Hebert","Sabrina Hickey","Kayla Noll","Andrea Peevy","Kwonchan Jeon","Ismatara Reena","William Hey","Jessica Reynolds","Penny Thomas","Ralph Wood"],"journal":"Pedagogical Research","datePublished":"2024-1-1","aiKeywords":["mental health and well-being","preventive health behaviors","perceptions of health risks","COVID-19 pandemic impact on faculty","academic productivity during crises","university faculty experiences"],"facultyKeywords":["Health services research","Education research nec","Public health","Education, general","Mental health, counseling, and therapy services and sciences","Education research","Sociology, general","Education, other","Ethnic studies","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies nec","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","Health sciences, other","Social sciences","Health sciences, general","Public health, general","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Higher education evaluation and research","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Education","Health sciences","Area studies"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.29333/pr/13885","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1177/11782218231222343","type":"paper","title":"Opioid Overdose Hospitalizations During COVID-19: The Experience of Pennsylvania","abstract":"## Objective:\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic placed extreme burden on hospitals, while opioid overdose is another challenging public health issue. This study aimed to examine the trends and outcomes of opioid overdose hospitalizations in Pennsylvania during 2018 to 2021.\\n\\n## Design:\\nWe identified opioid overdose hospitalizations in the state of Pennsylvania using the state-wide hospital discharge database (PHC4) 2018 to 2021. We examined the number of opioid overdose hospitalizations, the corresponding mortality and discharges against medical advice comparing the pre-COVID period (2018-2019) and the COVID period (2020-2021). We also assessed what patient and hospital characteristics were associated with in-hospital death or leaving against medical advice.\\n\\n## Results:\\nA total of 13 446 opioid-related hospitalizations were identified in 2018 to 2021. Compared to pre-pandemic, a higher percentage of cases involving synthetics (17.0%vs 10.3%, P < .0001) were observed during COVID. After controlling for covariates, there was no significant difference in opioid overdose in-hospital deaths in the years 2020 to 2021 compared to 2018 to 2019 (OR = 0.846, 95% CI: 0.71-1.01, P = .065). The COVID period was significantly associated with more leaving against medical advice compared to years 2018 to 2019 (OR = 1.265, 95% CI: 1.11-1.44, P = .0003). Compared to commercial insurance, Medicaid insurance was associated with higher odds of both in-hospital death (OR = 1.383, 95% CI: 1.06-1.81, P = .0176) and leaving against medical advice (OR = 1.903, 95% CI: 1.56-2.33, P < .0001).\\n\\n## Conclusion:\\nThere were no substantial changes in the number of overall opioid overdose cases and deaths at hospitals following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. This observation suggests that an increased number of patients may have succumbed to overdoses outside of hospital settings, possibly due to a higher severity of overdoses. Further, we found that patients were more likely to leave against medical advice during the COVID-19 pandemic.","authors":["James Douglas Thornton","Douglas L. Leslie","Li Wang","Chan Shen","Sarah S.

We evaluated if bill shape varies according to differences in dietary prey taken across geographical ranges (North America, Central America, South America, and Caribbean islands) in a ubiquitous, New World raptor species, the American kestrel (Falco sparverius). Specifically, we predicted that bills in geographies where kestrels consumed a larger proportion of vertebrates would be shorter and wider, with a larger tomial tooth. We reviewed the literature on kestrel diets across their range and quantified potential differences in bill shape using geometric morphometric methods for 245 museum specimens. The literature review revealed that most prey consumed by kestrels in North, South, and Central America were invertebrates (51.6–69.1%), whereas Caribbean kestrels consumed mostly vertebrates (61.4%), most of which were reptiles (77.3%). Morphometric analyses agreed with these findings; bill shape differed for island versus mainland kestrels but not among mainland regions. Bill shape on islands reflected a more robust bill with a larger tomial tooth, but had a longer hook, which we suggest is adaptive for consumption of lizard prey, more available on islands due to reduced competition with other raptors compared to mainland regions.","authors":["Mark C Belk","Chelsea M Berns","Robert M Bogardus","Landon R Jones"],"journal":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","datePublished":"2024-2-13","aiKeywords":["Feeding morphology","Dietary adaptation","Evolutionary biology","Geographical variation"],"facultyKeywords":["Plant sciences","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences","Ecology and evolutionary biology","Cell cellular and molecular biology","Developmental biology and embryology","Ecology","Cell cellular biology and anatomy","Animal sciences","Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Evolutionary biology","Biological and biomedical sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biolinnean/blae007","licenseUrl":"https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights"},{"id":"10.58680/rte2024583ab1","type":"paper","title":"Annotated Bibliography of Research in the Teaching of English","abstract":"Welcome to the new NCTE Publications site, your gateway to NCTE journals, ebooks, and the Council Chronicle.\\nThere is no abstract available.\\n\\nPreview this article:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is no abstract available.\\n\\n© 2024 by the National Council of Teachers of English\\n\\nArticle\\nNavigate this Journal \\nAbout \\nCurrent issue \\nPrevious issues \\nSubmit a manuscript \\nContact the editor \\n\\nISSN: \\nE-ISSN: \\nfile format pdf download\\nPDF\\nAuthor(s): Faye Autry1, Katherine Brodeur2, Candance Doerr-Stevens3, Amy Frederick4, Linda Haling5, Robin Jocius6, Megan McDonald Van Deventer7, Debra Peterson8, Jeff Share9, Andrea Suk10, Danielle Wagner11, Lisa Ortmann12, Erin Stutelberg13, Kathryn Allen14, Richard Beach15, Mikel W.

Several examples illustrate how such professionals’ responsibilities require knowing prevalent QR patterns in society, strategies for fostering sound reasoning, and the general nature of school curricula.

In this collaborative autoethnography, six researchers in three mentor-mentee dyads explored what it means to pursue Asian/Asian American feminist mentoring (A/AAFM), through dyadic and group interactive dialogues and collaborative analysis. A/AAFM can be conceptualized as anti-racist praxis, where each mentor attempted to consider mentoring as activism within academia, being grounded in values stemming from A/AA experiences and feminism. Results yielded a model of A/AAFM which emphasizes a convergence of multifaceted racial and cultural identities, feminist values, and activism. Three specific processes emerged: being holistic, relational, and mutual; a focus on community and intergenerational generosity; and intentional flattening of the power hierarchy. Implications for training and activism are discussed. Keywords: Activism, Asian, Asian American, feminism, mentoring. Disclosure statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s). Notes: 1 In this paper we utilize the terminology Asian/Asian American (A/AA), with the recognition that there are numerous terms to refer to people of Asian descent in the US. We chose this terminology given the composition of our research group (i.e., individuals who identify as Asian and/or Asian American) who generated the mentoring model, and in order to include experiences of Asian international students. In addition, we did not use the term Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) in order to honor the unique experiences of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations, whose experiences we do not capture in this study. 2 In this paper, we utilize the terminology mentee to refer to individuals who may be more junior in experience and training in a mentoring relationship.

We show that applying preference parameter values from experimental settings to market data can significantly understate the role of prospect theory in explaining investor behavior. We find evidence that mutual fund investors exhibit loss aversion and differential attitudes toward risk over losses (risk-seeking) and gains (risk-averse) but no significant probability weighting when evaluating fund performance. Our results apply more strongly to retail funds compared to institutional funds, consistent with the view that prospect theory is more relevant for retail investors. Finally, we show that, for parameter values that best explain fund flows, prospect theory outperforms the global risk aversion framework and widely-used asset pricing models in explaining investors’ responses to fund performance.\\n\\n**Keywords:** G11, G23, G40, loss aversion, mutual fund flows, prospect theory, reference-dependent preferences\\n\\n**Disclosure statement**\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).","authors":["Asli Eksi","Nikolaos Artavanis"],"journal":"Journal of Behavioral Finance","datePublished":"2024-5-14","aiKeywords":["Retail vs. institutional investors","Investor behavior","Loss aversion","Risk attitudes","Prospect theory","Mutual fund performance"],"facultyKeywords":["Research and experimental psychology","Business administration and management nec","Psychology","Research and experimental psychology nec","Cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics","Business","Behavioral neuroscience","Experimental psychology","Business administration and management"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15427560.2024.2348558","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1080/02615479.2024.2368174","type":"paper","title":"Insights from the lived experience of Buddhist ethics: implications for social work ethics education","abstract":"Ethics is largely dominated by European curriculum which includes Western moral theories such as deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and care ethics. To decenter this dominant ethics curriculum, the present phenomenological study explored the moral lived experience of ethics for Korean Buddhist (male and female) monastics (N = 21). Using three-level qualitative coding, data were thematically analyzed. Findings revealed three overarching themes (1) the importance of the saṅgha and community care, (2) the presence of ethical tensions, and (3) ethics as a practice. Each theme had two sub-themes.

The purpose of the study was to examine the interrelationships of PA enjoyment, exercise goal setting, exercise self-efficacy, and recording PA behaviors and the impact on PA. One thousand four hundred and seventy-six students at a public university in the United States responded to a questionnaire consisting of validated survey instruments regarding PA levels and exercise behaviors between 2014 and 2018. Exercise self-efficacy, PA enjoyment and recording PA were direct positive predictors of PA. Our findings reinforce the positive influence between PA enjoyment, exercise self-efficacy, and establishing exercise goals with increased PA.

The soundtracks come from Soul by Pete Docter and Kemp Powers and Nomadland by Chloé Zhao, both released in 2020. The films are sonically worlds apart: Soul is dominated by jazz music by Jon Batiste and contemporary electronic music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, while Nomadland features modern classical music by Ludovico Einaudi and Ólafur Arnalds. Ironically, despite sounding profoundly different, both films draw from true stories in order to teach audioviewers about living well, even in the midst of death. Or, to reapply Danijela’s words about Waking Life (Richard Linklater, 2001), these films emphasise “the dualistic nature of human experience, the pleasure of being alive and the implicit proximity of death.” Walker combines cinematherapy with sound studies to make a case for the wisdom of both films that have helped her cope with the grief of Danijela’s death, in the hope that this might resonate for those readers who find similar comfort in their own film-to-person relationships.","authors":["Elsie Walker"],"journal":"Alphaville: journal of film and screen media","datePublished":"2024-7-2","aiKeywords":["Human Experience and Duality","Coping with Grief","Life Lessons from Cinema","Soundtracks and Film Music","Cinematherapy"],"facultyKeywords":["Musicology and ethnomusicology","Psychology","Visual and performing arts","Cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences","Experimental psychology","Counseling and applied psychology nec","Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Visual arts, media studies design, and arts management nec","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Music performance","Performing arts","Counseling and applied psychology","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Film, cinema, and media studies","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Interdisciplinary computer sciences","Research and experimental psychology","Visual arts, media studies, and design","Behavioral neuroscience"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.33178/alpha.27.17","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1656/045.031.s1222","type":"paper","title":"Evaluating the Relationship between Injuries and Home-Range Size in the Endangered Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata)","abstract":"Predation can lead to nonlethal injury as well as mortality in turtles, with many Clemmys guttata (Spotted Turtle) having predator-induced limb and foot amputations. The impact of such injuries on movements of freshwater turtles remains poorly understood.

Seven turtles had at least 1 limb or foot completely amputated by a predator, and the remaining 13 were uninjured. When comparing movements among turtles, we found no difference in home-range sizes between male (n = 8) and female (n = 7) nor between injured (n = 7) and uninjured (n = 8) Spotted Turtles during their breeding season. However, injured turtles (n = 5) had smaller home ranges (mean ± SE = 0.26 ± 0.14 ha) than uninjured turtles (n = 12, 0.74 ± 0.15 ha) during the nonbreeding season, when turtles are more terrestrial.

Six different BIOabsorbable Polymeric Implant Naltrexone (BIOPIN) formulations, comprising combinations of Poly‐d,l‐Lactic Acid (PDLLA) and/or Polycaprolactone (PCL‐1 or PCL‐2), were used to create subcutaneous implants. Both placebo and naltrexone implants were implanted subcutaneously in male dogs. The active naltrexone implants consisted of two doses, 644 mg and 1288 mg. A challenge with IV fentanyl was performed in 33 male dogs at 97–100 days after implantation. Following the administration of a 30 μg/kg intravenous fentanyl dose, the placebo cohort manifested a swift and profound respiratory depression with a ~50% reduction in their pre‐dose respiratory rate (RR). The BIOPIN NTX‐implanted dogs were exposed to escalating doses of intravenous fentanyl (30 μg/kg, 60 μg/kg, 90 μg/kg, and 120 μg/kg). In contrast, the dogs implanted with the BIOPIN naltrexone implants tolerated doses up to 60 μg/kg without significant respiratory depression (<50%) but had severe respiratory depression with fentanyl doses of 90 μg/kg and especially at 120 μg/kg. Bioabsorbable, extended‐release BIOPIN naltrexone implants are effective in mitigating fentanyl‐induced respiratory depression in male canines at about 3 months after implantation. This technology may also have potential for mitigating fentanyl‐induced respiratory depression in humans.","authors":["Robert L. Joyner","Veera Holdai","Steven M. Cohen","Joseph A.

In addition, sociodemographic and environmental factors impact exercise motivation and physical activity; yet, only limited research has compared motivations and behaviors between different student groups. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare exercise motivation and physical activity among college students. In this quantitative cross-sectional survey study, a volunteer sample of 307 undergraduate students (75.2% White, 68.7% Female) enrolled in health and fitness courses at a Mid-Atlantic region United States University and Community College completed an online demographic questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3). A series of independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare relative autonomy index (RAI) and subscale scores (obtained via the BREQ-3), as well as physical activity scores (MET-minutes/week obtained via the IPAQ-SF). Statistically significant differences in exercise motivation and physical activity were found based on student age, housing status, major/program of study, and gender identity. In an effort to reduce health disparities, university administrators and coordinators are advised to keep these considerations in mind when developing physical activity policies and programs for college students.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: Physical activity, exercise motivation, college students\\n\\nDisclosure statement\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).","authors":["Tim Werner","Zachary Townsend","Daniel Smith","William Torrence"],"journal":"International Journal of Kinesiology in Higher Education","datePublished":"2024-8-5","aiKeywords":["Physical activity","Environmental factors impacting exercise","College student health behaviors","Exercise motivation","Sociodemographic factors in health"],"facultyKeywords":["Sociology, general","Health sciences, other","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Public health","Social sciences","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","Health sciences, general","Health sciences","Public health education and promotion","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies nec","Exercise science and kinesiology","Public health, general"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24711616.2024.2381442","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1080/07343469.2024.2393939","type":"paper","title":"The Isolated Presidency","abstract":"\\"The Isolated Presidency.\\" Congress & the Presidency, 51(3), pp. 360–361\\nCash, Jordan T.

This study examined the types of sources journalists included in 555 text-based solutions journalism articles from the U.S., Europe, and Africa collected from the Solutions Journalism Network. The results indicate solutions stories are meeting the goals set forth by proponents of the movement, as they most frequently include nonprofits/groups and unaffiliated citizens.

Estuaries and their corresponding tidal creeks have been impacted by human anthropogenic influences for decades, allowing a variety of restoration practices to be implemented in upland streams. In the face of climate variability and continuous human development pressures, this research performs statistical analysis and a wavelet coherence on, before, and after stream restoration for water quality changes in Chesapeake Bay’s tidal tributaries in the Lower Western Shore to identify if the restoration strategies have been effective in the mesohaline tidal creeks. Statistical analysis showed that currently, the receiving tidal basins are not seeing the required positive improvements in water quality after years of upland stream restoration. Compounding this is the fact climate variability cannot be ignored. Results indicate that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has significant wavelet coherence with bottom dissolved oxygen, precipitation, and nutrients. This suggests that current restoration efforts may not be able to keep up with climate variability, and other techniques (restoration or policies) may need to be implemented.","authors":["Diana L.

Integrated STEM education is attracting increased attention and gaining momentum from educators, politicians, STEM industries, and the media across the nation. Many state and national organizations have called for a new workforce of problem solvers, innovators, and inventors who are self‐reliant and able to think logically, also suggesting that creating such capacity is one of the critical foundations that drive innovative capacity in the nation. A key to developing these skills is STEM competencies and career goals in every K‐12 student. To do this, teachers must be educated on how to connect STEM careers and integrate STEM content into their curriculum. Providing integrated STEM micro‐credentials for preservice and in‐service teachers can be a flexible solution for providing teachers a method to learn how to improve their content knowledge and pedagogy (Digital Promise, 2019). Participants were a combination of undergraduate preservice teachers and graduate early‐career teachers who were asked about their STEM preparation. The majority of the participants received very little to no integrated STEM preparation. As a possible solution for this, participants were asked about their preferred type of professional development (PD) and if participating in a micro‐credential course would be a possibility. Nearly all of the participants agreed that a self‐paced micro‐credential that blended online and in‐person instruction would be something they would do to learn how to integrate STEM more effectively into their pedagogy. Micro‐credentials could be a successful solution for educator PD.","authors":["Gurupriya Ramanathan","Gina Solano"],"journal":"Future in Educational Research","datePublished":"2024-9-24","aiKeywords":["curriculum integration","teacher preparation","educational innovation","integrated STEM competencies","STEM education","professional development"],"facultyKeywords":["Teacher education","Teacher education, specific subject areas","Higher education evaluation and research","Education research nec","Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences","STEM educational methods","Curriculum and instruction","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Education","Interdisciplinary computer sciences","Education research"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fer3.55","licenseUrl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1002/csr.2979","type":"paper","title":"Of shepherds and sheep: Who sets the agenda for firms' attention to social issues?","abstract":"Corporate social responsibility has received much attention regarding how it can benefit firms and why firms voluntarily address social issues.

We find that the salience of the problems in traditional media influences the social issues firms address in their CSR reports, and over time, the agenda‐setting effect of traditional media on firms has increased, solidifying traditional media's role as curators of social issues.","authors":["Ronei Leonel","Jae Hwan Lee","Elise Perrault"],"journal":"Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management","datePublished":"2024-9-22","aiKeywords":["salience of social issues","media influence on corporate behavior","firm decision-making processes","corporate social responsibility (CSR)","agenda-setting theory"],"facultyKeywords":["Public policy analysis, general","Business administration and management nec","Sociology, general","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Social sciences","Business administration and management","Public policy analysis","Business","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Business management and administration"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csr.2979","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1123/jpah.2023-0508","type":"paper","title":"Factors Associated With Leisure-Time Bicycling Among Adults in the United States: An Urban–Rural Comparison","abstract":"Background:Bicycling is a healthy form of physical activity that can be performed by most adults as part of leisure-time (LT) activity. However, little is known about LT bicycling behaviors, especially in the rural areas of the United States. This study sought to contrast the prevalence and factors associated with LT bicycling in populations living in urban settings with those living in rural settings.Methods:The 2019 Behavior Risk Factor Survey, which contains information regarding LT physical activity behaviors among adults (N = 396,261) in the United States, was used to determine the prevalence, demographic profile, and likelihood of meeting the physical activity guidelines of LT bicyclists. The 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban/Rural Classification Scheme was used to classify respondents living in rural and urban settings.Results:Among US adults, 3.8% (95% CI, 3.7–3.9) reported LT bicycling activity, the sixth most common physical activity. Adults living in urban counties compared with rural counties had a greater prevalence of LT bicycling (3.9% vs 2.3%, respectively), with adults living in rural counties having a 34% lower probability of LT bicycling. Rural bicycling prevalence rates were lower across all demographics. Urban bicyclists, compared with rural bicyclists, cycled more months of the year. Overall, 85.5% of all bicyclists met the aerobic physical guidelines, with no differences between urban and rural bicyclists.Conclusions:Bicycling remains an important LT physical activity among adults in the United States. However, a rural–urban difference in the prevalence does exist for LT bicycling. The reasons for this disparity warrant further investigation.","authors":["Christiaan Abildso","Zachary Townsend","Jeanette Gustat","Carissa Smock","Eugene C. Fitzhugh","Debra Kellstedt","Laura E.

AR BFR cuffs adjust pressure as the muscle undergoes concentric and eccentric contractions, maintaining a constant pressure in the limb throughout the entire range of motion. NAR BFR training cuffs do not adjust pressure throughout the range of motion thus causing greater pressures in the limb during concentric contraction when the muscle size is enlarged. How this exercise acutely impacts arterial stiffness in upper body exercise is not well understood.\\nMETHODS: Following a randomized familiarization period with AR or NAR BFR biceps curl exercise, 33 adults (20 ± 2 years; 11 females) participated in 3 randomized sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR (no cuffs) separated by 1-week washout periods. Using 20% of the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) with 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence, participants performed 4 sets of biceps curls to failure. Training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR sessions. Measurements before and immediately following the training session included blood pressure acquisition, arterial tonometry, and ultrasonography of the carotid artery. Between and within effects of treatment on central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), central diastolic BP (cDBP), central pulse pressure (cPP), central mean arterial pressure (cMAP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (β-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC) were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs.\\nRESULTS: There were no baseline differences in variable of interest (all p > 0.05). cDBP increased posted exercise in all three groups (AR-BFR mean difference (MD) = 7 ± 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; NAR-BFR MD = 6 ± 1 mmHg, p < 0.01; no BFR MD = 5 ± 1 mmHg, p < 0.01). And there was a non-significant trend in β-stiff (MD = 1.25 ± 0.46 au, p = 0.07) and AC (MD = -0.3 ± 0.1 mm2/mmHg x 10-1, p = 0.07) with the no BFR treatment.\\nCONCLUSION: The present findings show acute AR-BFR and NAR-BFR bicep training did not impact arterial stiffness.

AR-BFR pressure cuffs adjust pressure automatically, maintaining a similar pressure during concentric and eccentric phases. However, NAR-BFR pressure cuffs do not accommodate for larger muscle diameters during the concentric phase, creating higher limb pressures compared to the eccentric phase.\\nMETHODS: Accordingly, 33 adults (21 ± 2 years; 11 females) participated in the upper body and 20 adults (23 ± 5 years; 7 females) participated in the lower body in treatment-order exercise sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no BFR in a randomized fashion separated by 1-week and included a familiarization session. All participants in the upper body sessions performed four sets of dumbbell curls and all participants in the lower body sessions performed four sets of wall squats with handheld dumbbells to volitional fatigue using 20% of their 1-RM with 2-second cadence and 1 minute rest periods. Cuffs were placed at the proximal portion of the arms and thighs, and limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both BFR treatments during the exercise and rest periods for both the upper and lower body sessions, respectively. Subjective measurements of RPE, RPD, and the 1-10 Likert scale were taken immediately post-exercise while the cuffs were inflated. Two-way ANOVAs were conducted on variables of interest.\\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in RPE between AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no BFR in the upper and lower body sessions (p = 0.13). There was a significant difference in RDP between upper body AR-BFR and no BFR (mean difference (MD) = 2.23 ± 0.47, p < 0.01) and upper body NAR-BFR and no BFR (mean difference (MD) = 1.32 ± 0.47, p = 0.05).\\nCONCLUSION: The use of BFR does not appear to influence subjective ratings of exertion in the upper and lower limbs. Additionally, AR-BFR and NAR-BFR devices may cause more subjective discomfort compared to no BFR.

Results: Post-exercise changes in central and brachial diastolic blood pressure were decreased in all groups.

Countries, communities and organizations are realizing that passing profits to workers increases wealth at all levels of society. The benefits, widely known, include personal prosperity, organizational profitability and stability, and a host of economic benefits for communities in which EO companies operate. Selling a company to employees, or starting a cooperative organization containing worker owners, is not without risk. New skills are required for the company to reap the rewards inherent in EO organizations, but the method of creating this change varies significantly from one organization to another. Each is unique, but there are some factors that are common to most EO organizations that have achieved a dynamic organizational culture. These factors, which are critical for success, can be isolated using structured research, organized through a lens of general systems theory and operationalized using principles of Learning Management (LM). The result is an organized knowledge transfer plan that maximizes resources and provides the highest probability of a successful transition to a uniquely profitable EO company. **KEYWORDS**: Employee ownership, knowledge transfer, learning management, critical success factors, engagement culture **JEL CLASSIFICATION**: O43\\n\\n1. Overview Research indicates that extraordinarily successful employee-owned (EO) organizations have a culture that supports everyday employee engagement (*Berry and Fitz-Gerald Citation 2018), making a unique contribution to the prosperity of the organization. Why this occurs is the subject of ongoing research designed to discover what factors contribute to employee-ownership principles, and result in increases in revenues and profitability. Literature containing information on high-performing work systems (HPWS) seems to lay a foundation for EO practices (Calo and Shipper, Citation 2018), but the commitment, and ownership mentality occurs in highly successful organizations that are owned by employees in trusts, cooperative agreements, or through equity arrangements. The results of EO are well documented and include organizations outperforming competitors in a variety of areas (Kruse Citation 2022), attracting and maintaining top talent (Kurland Citation 2018) increases in innovation and efficiency (*Agafitei and Avasilcai Citation 2015), and resilience during economic downturns. For employee-owners, the benefits are also substantial and include job satisfaction and security (Uzuriaga, 2028), increased motivation (Blasi et al. Citation 2008) and of course the financial rewards that come from owning equity in the organization, among others. One of the largest benefits of EO, however, may be the economic benefits seen by communities when workers become owners (*Inserra, Conway, and Rodat Citation 2002). Jobs are preserved and increased in local communities (J. R. *Blasi, Freeman, and Kruse Citation 2013), and stability is improved with the longer-term outlook of EO organizations. EO companies also tend to have a reciprocal commitment to the communities in which they reside, contributing to an upward spiral of growth and economic prosperity. Some scholars note that EO organizations have higher levels of commitment to the environment, locally and beyond, and often engage in practices that are ecologically and socially sustainable. None of these benefits are realized merely because of transferring ownership to employees. They become a reality when employees begin to think like owners – at all levels of the organization. The first portion of this paper is dedicated to the factors that create this unique culture within EO organizations, and the latter is devoted to operationalizing – actually transforming – workers into owners. This paper delivers a set of critical success factors (CSFs) of employee ownership as discovered in approximately 100 carefully curated articles, cases, and books dedicated to the subject of employee engagement in EO organizations. CSF research is appropriate because it is designed to produce a set of factors that must receive top priority during a high-stakes implementation (Ram and Corkindale Citation 2014), and if they are neglected, the likelihood of success decreases significantly. CSF is used to manage enterprise-wide change initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions, complex software implementations and other major projects (Trkman Citation 2010). Becoming employee-owned requires a level of business acumen that needs to be supported by research, which must be translated into activities that will contribute directly to the success of the firm. Using the methods outlined in the next section, a metasynthesis was undertaken that yielded CSFs and their context, as reported by dozens of successful organizations. The broad CSFs discovered in the literature are as follows: Accountability/Responsibility, Communication, Governance, Innovation, Leadership, Working in Teams, Training, Transparency (Especially in Finance). There were other CSFs identified in the literature that were shown to be a result of attending to other CSFs over time. This paper was developed to explain the process of implementing employee ownership, and the below are outcomes: Culture – Values, Engagement, HR Practices, Recruiting, Selection, Onboarding, Training and Development, Rewards and Recognition, Retention.","authors":["Frank Shipper","Valerie J.

The prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with symptoms of arrhythmia, palpitations, is well documented but how this compares to patients at the greatest risk for major cardiac arrythmia is unknown.\\n\\nObjectives:The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of anxiety or depression in patients with symptomatic palpitations vs patients at risk for major cardiac arrhythmia (congestive heart failure) and further evaluate the effects on their quality of life using the SF-36 assessment tool.\\n\\nMethods:Patients with palpitations (50 subjects) or prior ICD (50 subjects) were given the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).\\n\\nResults:There was an insignificant trend for increased anxiety, with a mean GAD-7 score in palpitations group of 4.14 vs 3.04 in CHF group with anxiety prevalence in 40% palpitations and 28% of ICD patients. The mean score of PHQ-9 in palpitations group is 4.84 vs 4.96 in CHF group with 38% of the palpitation group having depression compared to 44% of the ICD group. The SF-36 physical function domain showed that the palpitations group was more functional than the ICD group with a mean score of 0.709 in palpitations group vs 0.513 in CHF group (P <0.05.) Subjective frequency of palpitations had a mean of 3.47 in the palpitation group vs 1.5 in the CHF group with P<0.05.\\n\\nConclusions:Patients presenting with symptomatic palpitations have more symptoms of anxiety than patients at risk for major arrythmia, but have less functional limitations than the ICD group, as expected. There is a non-significant trend to more anxiety in the palpitations group, but both groups are far above populations norms of 2-4%. Depression is not different between the groups but both groups are far above the population averages of 5-6%. Patients with palpitations have fewer physical limitations but have at least an equal amount of anxiety and depression as a far more ill group of patients. It is a standard of care to treat symptomatic palpitations due to PVCs with beta blockers; this will not help symptoms of anxiety and it may worsen depression. When seeing patients presenting with palpitations, or patients with chronic heart disease and an ICD, we should consider an evaluation for anxiety and depression.","authors":["Kunnal Patel","Veera Holdai","Justin Rissmiller","Mark Treuth"],"journal":"Circulation","datePublished":"2024-11-12","aiKeywords":["Quality of life in cardiac patients","Comparison of anxiety and depression prevalence","Mental health consequences of cardiac symptoms","Symptomatic palpitations vs major cardiac arrhythmia risk factors"],"facultyKeywords":["Health services research","Neurobiology and neurosciences","Neuroscience","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Physiology, general","Health sciences, general","Public health","Public health, general","Medical clinical science","Health sciences","Mental health, counseling, and therapy services and sciences","Neurobiology and neurosciences nec","Biological and biomedical sciences","Health sciences, other","Oncology and cancer biology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/circ.150.suppl_1.4148046","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.3390/meteorology3040019","type":"paper","title":"Evolution of Synoptic Systems Associated with Lake-Effect Snow Events over Northwestern Pennsylvania","abstract":"This study investigates the synoptic conditions associated with lake-effect snow (LES) over northwestern Pennsylvania with a focus on classifying cases based on the tracks of cyclones influencing the region, including Nor’easters (NEs), Alberta Clippers (ACs), Colorado Lows (COs), and Great Lakes Lows (GLs).

Synoptic composites of all LES cases exhibited an archetypal LES synoptic pattern consisting of an upper-level low geopotential height anomaly over the Hudson Bay and surface dipole structure centered across the Great Lakes basin. Regarding the different tracks, NEs and COs featured dynamic support in the form of enhanced turbulent mixing and synoptic vertical forcing, while ACs and GLs had greater thermodynamic support in the form of higher lapse rates and heightened heat and moisture fluxes. However, the bootstrapping analysis revealed minimal differences in LES impact between the cyclone types.","authors":["Christopher Elcik","Jake Wiley"],"journal":"Meteorology","datePublished":"2024-11-20","aiKeywords":["synoptic conditions","cyclone classification","mesoscale meteorology","lake-effect snow","winter weather impact","atmospheric dynamics"],"facultyKeywords":["Climatology, atmospheric chemistry and physics","Ocean marine sciences and atmospheric science","Geosciences, atmospheric, and ocean sciences","Atmospheric sciences and meteorology, general"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/meteorology3040019","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.5465/amp.2024.0109","type":"paper","title":"Digital Activism: Beyond Collective Actions and Hashtags","abstract":"Academy of Management Perspectives\\nIn-Press\\nExchanges\\nDigital Activism: Beyond Collective Actions and Hashtags\\nRonei Leonel, Kathleen Rehbein and Michelle Westermann-Behaylo\\n\\nAccepted by Geoffrey Wood\\nPublished Online: 18 Nov 2024\\nhttps://doi.org/10.5465/amp.2024.0109\\n\\nAbstract There is an ongoing debate about whether digital media undermines or enhances the ability of stakeholders—in particular, secondary stakeholders—to influence a firm’s policies and practices. One prevailing perspective (Barnett, Henriques & Husted, 2020; Barnett, Henriques & Husted, 2024) is that digital media leads to slacktivism, a token display of support, which impedes the ability of stakeholders to act collectively and makes it easier for firms to dismiss stakeholder claims. Another perspective (Colleoni, Zyglidopoulos & Illia, 2024) argues that even though synchronicity may be difficult to achieve, digital media in the form of hashtags makes it easier for heterogeneous stakeholders to converge around a broader demand for societal change and indirectly pressure firms to change their policies and practices. In this exchange, we expand on Colleoni, Zyglidopoulos, and Illia’s (2024) arguments by encompassing other forms of digital activism beyond generic hashtags. Drawing from the logic of connective action, we argue that two universal pathways—connectivity and velocity—applicable across a wide range of digital activism, are reshaping and enhancing stakeholders’ ability to influence a firm’s social policies and practices.","authors":["Kathleen Rehbein","Ronei Leonel","Michelle Westermann-Behaylo"],"journal":"Academy of Management Perspectives","datePublished":"2024-11-18","aiKeywords":["Impact of digital activism on corporate policies","Connectivity and velocity in stakeholder engagement","Digital media and stakeholder influence","Slacktivism vs. digital activism","Collective action in the digital age"],"facultyKeywords":["Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Business","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Political science and government","Business administration and management","Social sciences","Political science and government nec","Sociology, general","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Public policy analysis","Interdisciplinary computer sciences","Public policy analysis, general","Business management and administration","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Organizational leadership","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5465/amp.2024.0109","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1080/02640414.2024.2422205","type":"paper","title":"Impact of limb occlusion pressure assessment position on performance, cardiovascular, and perceptual responses in blood flow restricted low-load resistance exercise: A randomized crossover trial","abstract":"This study investigated the effect of limb occlusion pressure (LOP) position on exercise performance, cardiovascular responses, and perceptual experiences during seated bilateral leg extensions with and without blood flow restriction (BFR).

We explored habitat preferences and potential interspecific resource competition in the endangered Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata). For habitat data, water quality measurements were recorded once per trapping session, while canopy cover and vegetation data were recorded once per field season. We also investigated niche overlap in habitat and food resources between C. guttata and other, more common, turtle species. Our data indicated that the abundance of C. guttata was negatively correlated with dissolved O2 and pH levels and positively correlated with body of water depth and canopy cover. The investigation of niche overlap revealed that Mud Turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum) and Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta), but not Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina), were negatively correlated with the abundance of C. guttata despite differences in characteristics of bodies of water used by each species. We used structural equation modeling to better understand if the relationships between C. guttata and other turtles were due to direct interactions or simply reflected environmental influences. We then used stable isotope analyses to compare similarities in δ13C and δ15N isotopes as proxies for diet overlap between C. guttata and other turtles and ultimately found that all species had similar, broad diets. The inverse relationship between abundance of C. guttata and other species, paired with the overlap in dietary niche space, suggests there is potential for interspecific interactions to negatively impact the abundance of C. guttata within turtle communities on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The results of this study highlight that management efforts may need to consider that species of conservation concern coexist with more common species, especially as habitat loss decreases the breadth of habitat available.","authors":["Eric B.

Few studies of sex‐biased dispersal have been conducted in turtles, but a handful of studies, in saltwater turtles and in terrestrial turtles, have detected male‐biased dispersal as expected. We tested for sex‐biased dispersal in the endangered freshwater turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) by investigating fine‐scale genetic spatial structure of males and females. We found significant spatial genetic structure in both sexes, but the patterns mimicked each other. Both males and females typically had higher than expected relatedness at distances <25 km, and in many distance classes greater than 25 km, less than expected relatedness. Similar patterns were apparent whether we used only loci in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (n= 7) or also included loci with potential null alleles (n= 5). We conclude that, contrary to expectations, sex‐biased dispersal is not occurring in this species, possibly related to the reverse sexual dimorphism in this species, with females having brighter colors. We did, however, detect significant spatial genetic structure in males and females, separate and combined, showing philopatry within a genetic patch size of <25 km inC. guttata, which is concerning for an endangered species whose populations are often separated by distances greater than the genetic patch size.","authors":["Stephanie M.

Based on the decision tree analysis, we develop a new multivariate information metric, Internal Relevance (IR), to measure the extent to which the revisions of analysts’ consensus earnings and sales forecasts are incorporated into the revisions of consensus target prices. We show that stocks with higher IR have stronger market reactions to target price revisions in terms of abnormal return, abnormal trading volume, and abnormal return volatility. These results remain consistent across a series of robustness checks. Finally, we perform portfolio analysis to show that IR can be used to screen stocks to improve trading profitability.\\n\\n**KEYWORDS:** Decision tree analysis, earnings and sales forecasts, market reactions, target prices, portfolio analysis\\n\\n**JEL CLASSIFICATION:** G10, G24, G14, G11\\n\\n**Disclosure statement**\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\\n\\n**Notes**\\n1. In this paper, we focus on consensus outputs rather than individual analysts’ outputs for two reasons. First, IR is conceptualized as a stock-level, rather than analyst-level, characteristic. Second, the limited number of observations at the analyst level may result in unreliable estimation for IR. It should be noted that earnings forecasts, sales forecasts, target prices, and their revisions in the remainder of the paper are consensus, unless otherwise noted.\\n2. Brown and Huang (Citation2013) define a pair of recommendation and earnings forecast to be consistent if both are above (or below) the consensus level. Unlike Brown and Huang (Citation2013), Iselin, Park, and Van Buskirk (Citation2021) define analyst consistency based on three outputs: earnings forecasts, stock recommendations, and target prices. An analyst is identified consistent if the analyst revises all three outputs upward (or downward) compared with the prior estimates.\\n3. Indeed, several studies consider more than two analysts’ outputs (Asquith, Mikhail, and Au Citation2005; Bradshaw, Brown, and Huang Citation2013; Brav and Lehavy Citation2003). However, the major foci have been on the investigation of the incremental informativeness of one output relative to others, i.e., the market reaction to target price revisions controlling for stock recommendation and earnings forecast revisions. In contrast, we explore the contemporaneous interconnections between two intermediate outputs and one terminal output.\\n4. We treat target price revisions as a categorical variable since the CART algorithm, in modelling analysts’ revisions, performs better in classification tree than in regression tree. Decision tree analysis is prone to overfitting. To address that issue, we specify a relatively large cost-of-complexity value to generate an initial tree and then perform the pruning process by checking whether the tree is associated with the minimum of cross-validation errors. Our results are robust regardless of whether the pruning process is performed or not.\\n5. We thank the anonymous reviewer for pointing this out. 6. The literature documents the impacts of regulatory changes on analyst behaviour such as Reg FD, NASD Rule 2711, NYSE Rule 472, e.g. see Chan, Lo, and Su (Citation2014); Mohanram and Sunder (Citation2006); Palmon and Yezegel (Citation2011). Reg FD was implemented in October 2000 and NASD Rule 2711 (NYSE Rule 472) was initially adopted in 2002–2003. 7. The consensus target price revision event refers to the date when consensus target price changes. It can be triggered either when one or more analysts revise their own target prices, or when one or more analysts stop issuing the target prices, or when one or more analysts start to follow the stocks and issue new target prices, or a combination thereof. 8. We thank the anonymous reviewer for suggesting this approach to address the issue of sample selection bias. 9. We obtain the weekly returns and factors extracted from Kenneth R. French data library at https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html. 10. Similar to our decision tree analysis, we rescale the change of weekly consensus by stock price to make the calculation comparable. To obtain reliable regression fits, we further require that each stock-year sub-sample contain at least 20 non-missing observations. 11. The definition of (in)consistency is different from those in the literature in several ways: first, existing literature examines the consistency of a pair of revisions issued by the same analyst, while ours is based on the joint movement of the weekly consensus; second, existing literature treats (in)consistency as a binary variable to capture the directions of the link, while ours focuses on the proportion of (in)consistency to capture the strength of the link.","authors":["Jahangir Sultan","Wenxiu (Vince) Nan","Tao Li"],"journal":"Applied Economics","datePublished":"2023-1-5","aiKeywords":["Portfolio Management and Trading Strategies","Impact of Consensus Earnings and Sales Forecasts","Analyst Decision-Making Processes","Market Reactions to Forecast Revisions","Development of Financial Metrics"],"facultyKeywords":["Computational and applied mathematics","Statistics","Business","Applied statistics, general","Business administration and management","Applied mathematics nec","Applied mathematics","Mathematics and statistics","Business administration and management nec","Business management and administration"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00036846.2022.2131722","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.3390/jrfm16020069","type":"paper","title":"CSR, Risk Management Practices, and Performance Outcomes: An Empirical Investigation of Firms in Different Industries","abstract":"This article presents a research model that defines how external drivers impact financial performance outcomes, and the role played by strategic practices (especially CSR) in reducing the negative impact of such external influences.

The results indicate that although external supply chain risk drivers do negatively impact a firm’s financial performance, the influence of these risk events can be mitigated if firms adopt focused strategic practices. The results highlight the significant role played by CSR strategic practices in enabling firms to develop resilience from disruption events. In our research model, CSR, as an organizational linkage practice, is positioned in between upfront strategic flow and back-end performance flow. It suggests that CSR success is only possible when CSR is implemented broadly throughout organizational processes.

Analysis of fieldnotes from 30 observations, student writing products, and reflective interviews with focal students and the teacher illuminated the meaningful assemblages where conditions of intimacy permeated instruction. Two practices supported intimacy in working conditions: knowledge about writing built through a collective process of noticing, and open-ended work time characterized by “managed nonmanagement” (, p. 176), or calculated flexibility in rules and expectations. Findings illustrate how a literacy practice might contribute to students’ experience of alienation or intimacy (or both) while writing, depending on conditions of industrialization and commodification. Even as the teacher strove to deindustrialize work, commodification through grades and standardized assessments heightened alienation in the writing environment.

We hypothesize that this paving behavior can be applied to monitor S. invicta and T. melanocephalum. In the present study, 3998 adhesive tapes, each with a food source (sausage), were placed in 20 locations around Guangzhou, China (181–224 tapes per location), and their efficiency to detect S. invicta and T. melanocephalum was compared with two traditional ant-monitoring methods, baiting and pitfall trapping. Overall, S. invicta was detected by 45.6% and 46.4% of baits and adhesive tapes, respectively. In each location, the percentage of adhesive tapes detecting S. invicta and T. melanocephalum was similar when compared to baits and pitfall traps. However, significantly more non-target ant species showed up on bait and pitfall traps. Seven non-target ant species—Pheidole parva Mayr (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole nodus Smith (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole sinica Wu & Wang (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole yeensis Forel (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Carebara affinis (Jerdon) (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Camponotus nicobarensis Mayr (Formicidae: Formicinae), and Odontoponera transversa (Smith) (Formicidae: Ponerinae)—also showed tape paving behavior, but they can be easily distinguished morphologically from S. invicta and T. melanocephalum. Our study showed that the paving behavior occurs in different subfamilies of ants (i.e., myrmicinae, dolichoderinae, formicinae, and ponerinae). In addition, paving behavior can potentially be used to develop more specific monitoring methods for S. invicta and T. melanocephalum in urban areas in southern China.","authors":["Xuan Chen","Jiacheng Cai","Chengju Du","Lei Wang","Chao Wen","Cai Wang","Yan Hua","Xiujun Wen","Liming Shen"],"journal":"Insects","datePublished":"2023-2-23","aiKeywords":["Urban pest management","Monitoring techniques for invasive species","Ant behavior and ecology"],"facultyKeywords":["Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences nec","Ecology","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences","Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Ecology and evolutionary biology","Biological and biomedical sciences","Microbiology, general","Microbiology and immunology","Epidemiology and biostatistics"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects14030219","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1111/gcb.16625","type":"paper","title":"Is the future female for turtles? Climate change and wetland configuration predict sex ratios of a freshwater species","abstract":"Climate change and land‐use change are leading drivers of biodiversity decline, affecting demographic parameters that are important for population persistence. For example, scientists have speculated for decades that climate change may skew adult sex ratios in taxa that express temperature‐dependent sex determination (TSD), but limited evidence exists that this phenomenon is occurring in natural settings. For species that are vulnerable to anthropogenic land‐use practices, differential mortality among sexes may also skew sex ratios. We sampled the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), a freshwater species with TSD, across a large portion of its geographic range (Florida to Maine), to assess the environmental factors influencing adult sex ratios. We present evidence that suggests recent climate change has potentially skewed the adult sex ratio of spotted turtles, with samples following a pattern of increased proportions of females concomitant with warming trends, but only within the warmer areas sampled. At intermediate temperatures, there was no relationship with climate, while in the cooler areas we found the opposite pattern, with samples becoming more male biased with increasing temperatures. These patterns might be explained in part by variation in relative adaptive capacity via phenotypic plasticity in nest site selection. Our findings also suggest that spotted turtles have a context‐dependent and multi‐scale relationship with land use. We observed a negative relationship between male proportion and the amount of crop cover (within 300 m) when wetlands were less spatially aggregated. However, when wetlands were aggregated, sex ratios remained consistent. This pattern may reflect sex‐specific patterns in movement that render males more vulnerable to mortality from agricultural machinery and other threats. Our findings highlight the complexity of species' responses to both climate change and land use, and emphasize the role that landscape structure can play in shaping wildlife population demographics.","authors":["Glenn Johnson","Eric B.

Here, we optimized the hyperglycemic‐induction protocol, characterized deficits in nerve structure and behavioral function, and then examined the regenerative potential following recovery from the hyperglycemic state.\\n\\n## Results:\\nIn agreement with our previous work, hyperglycemia induced motor nerve degeneration and behavioral deficits. However, the optimized protocol initiated disruption of tight junctions within the blood‐nerve barrier, a phenotype apparent in mammalian models of DPN. Following a 10‐day recovery period, regeneration of motor nerve components was apparent, but behavioral deficits persisted. We next examined the effect of hyperglycemia on the musculoskeletal system and found subtle deficits in muscle that resolved following recovery, and robust deficits in the skeletal system which persisted following recovery.\\n\\n## Conclusion:\\nHere we optimized our previous model of hyperglycemia‐induced motor nerve degeneration to more closely align with that observed in mammalian models and then characterized the regenerative potential following recovery from hyperglycemia. Notably, we observed striking impairments to skeletal development, which underscores the global impact hyperglycemia has across systems, and provides a framework for elucidating molecular mechanisms responsible for regenerative events moving forward.","authors":["Sheridan Sargent","Jessica Kennett Clark","Anna Brennan"],"journal":"Developmental Dynamics","datePublished":"2023-3-15","aiKeywords":["Impact of hyperglycemia on the musculoskeletal system","Zebrafish as a model organism for studying diabetic conditions","Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) models","Hyperglycemia and its effects on nerve degeneration","Nerve regeneration mechanisms"],"facultyKeywords":["Neurobiology and neurosciences","Health sciences, general","Public health","Genetics and genomics","Genetics, general","Neuroscience","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Biomechanics","Health sciences, other","Neurobiology and anatomy","Human medical genetics","Public health, general","Medical clinical science","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Molecular genetics","Environmental health","Health sciences","Oncology and cancer biology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dvdy.583","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1139/cjb-2022-0051","type":"paper","title":"Soil drainage-class influences on the distribution of witness trees (1664–1700) in Wicomico County, Maryland, USA","abstract":"Given the long-term human habitation and prolific land use change trajectories in the eastern United States, few remnants of the pre-European settlement Mid-Atlantic forest remain on the Atlantic Coastal Plain.

Most amphibians have a biphasic lifestyle and are susceptible to threats in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Eastern Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum) are endangered throughout much of their range in the eastern United States, including Maryland and Delaware. Ambystoma t. tigrinum breed in ephemeral freshwater ponds and then migrate into the surrounding terrestrial environment after metamorphosis. Limited research exists about what habitat characteristics play a role in breeding pond use. We sought to understand what features of the breeding pond and surrounding landscape influence abundance and occupancy. We measured salamander occupancy, salamander abundance, and water quality parameters at ponds during the 2018 and 2019 breeding seasons. We used geographic information systems to determine pond area and the percentage of forest area and road density surrounding a pond at four spatial scales. Pond occupancy by A. t. tigrinum was positively associated with increased depth and less forest cover at the largest spatial scales. Abundance of A. t. tigrinum was greatest in larger, deeper ponds, potentially because these factors increase hydroperiod. More basic pH and decreased conductivity were also associated with higher male salamander abundances in ponds. Forest area and road density were not in the top-ranked model, although we note that ponds in this study had a minimum of 70% forest area within 150 m. Our findings elucidate relationships between A. t. tigrinum and their habitat, providing knowledge for future management of this state-endangered species.","authors":["Eric B. Liebgold","Hannah G.

Frontline Employee Perceptions of Customer Deviant Behaviors and Service Firms’ Guardianship Policies","abstract":"Recent disruptions, labor shortages, and fiscal pressures, especially in retail service environments, have necessitated and highlighted changes in the roles and responsibilities of frontline employees, often requiring them to enforce mask mandates and police customer deviant behavior (CDB). While extant work has investigated the impact of policing, or guardianship, for customers and firms, there has been limited examination regarding the policies themselves and the corresponding toll exacted upon frontline employees (FLEs) and their managers (FLMs). Thus, this phenomenon warranted an in-depth, multi-method investigation, including a full-scale qualitative exploration substantiated and extended via three experiments and a survey. The qualitative approach probes employees’ feelings about and identifies categories of CDB in retail service settings as well as develops a novel typology of guardianship policies (policy type x approach style). The subsequent studies empirically test the CDB guardianship typology in the context of a particularly detrimental type of CDB—shoplifting, while advancing understanding of firm-related (guardianship expectations), employee-related (trait anxiety) and job role-related (FLE vs FLM) contextual factors impacting perceptions of policy fairness and turnover intentions. The findings provide rich insights for practitioners and scholars by offering a novel guardianship typology and an extensive agenda for future research.","authors":["Patrick B. Fennell","Kristina K.

Firms benefit from making such contributions when the government suddenly intervenes in the market. We explore this value-creation mechanism in terms of the firm-investor relationship, not in terms of the traditional firm-government relationship. When a government intervention is being proposed or approved, firms that have made political contributions coordinating with political candidates are likely to enjoy better stock market returns than those that have not made such contributions. We also argue that firms that have made political contributions may experience lower stock returns than those that have not when the intervention plan is rejected. By focusing on the U.S. government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of 2008, our event study analysis with three news announcements finds that financial institutions that made political action committee (PAC) contributions indeed enjoyed higher stock returns when TARP was proposed and eventually approved. However, we do not find support for the investors’ devaluation of political contributions when TARP was once rejected during the review process. The findings propose that managers can use corporate political contributions as a strategic option to help investors reduce investment uncertainty by presenting their readiness for any unexpected change in the regulatory environment.","authors":["Yoon-Suk Baik","Jihyun Eun","Seung-Hyun Lee"],"journal":"Journal of General Management","datePublished":"2023-3-16","aiKeywords":["Corporate Political Contributions","Government Market Interventions","Regulatory Changes","Social Capital","Investment Uncertainty","Firm-Investor Relationship"],"facultyKeywords":["Business","Social sciences","Political science and government","Economics, general","Business administration and management","Business administration and management nec","Economics","Political science and government, general","Public policy analysis","Public policy analysis, general","Applied economics","Business management and administration"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03063070231164100","licenseUrl":"https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license"},{"id":"10.1177/07334648231167944","type":"paper","title":"Identifying Healthcare Stereotype Threat in Older Gay Men Living with HIV","abstract":"Healthcare stereotype threat (HCST) is defined as “being reduced to group stereotypes within an individual’s healthcare encounter,” leading to experiences of stigma and discrimination.

RPA binds ssDNA with high affinity but can also diffuse along ssDNA. By itself, RPA is capable of transiently disrupting short regions of duplex DNA by diffusing from a ssDNA that flanks the duplex DNA. Using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence and optical trapping combined with fluorescence approaches, we show thatS. cerevisiaePif1 can use its ATP-dependent 5′ to 3′ translocase activity to chemomechanically push a single human RPA (hRPA) heterotrimer directionally along ssDNA at rates comparable to those of Pif1 translocation alone. We further show that using its translocation activity, Pif1 can push hRPA from a ssDNA loading site into a duplex DNA causing stable disruption of at least 9 bp of duplex DNA. These results highlight the dynamic nature of hRPA enabling it to be readily reorganized even when bound tightly to ssDNA and demonstrate a mechanism by which directional DNA unwinding can be achieved through the combined action of a ssDNA translocase that pushes an SSB protein. These results highlight the two basic requirements for any processive DNA helicase: transient DNA base pair melting (supplied by hRPA) and ATP-dependent directional ssDNA translocation (supplied by Pif1) and that these functions can be unlinked by using two separate proteins.","authors":["Roberto Galletto","Joshua E.

To date, there have been few tests of this assumption at the scale of continents, so it is unclear if this is a large‐scale problem. Here, we examined the assumption that insect taxa show similar responses to temperature at 96 sites in grassy habitats across North America. We sampled insects with Malaise traps during 2019–2021 (N= 1041 samples) and examined the biomass of insects in relation to temperature and time of season. Our samples mostly contained Diptera (33%), Lepidoptera (19%), Hymenoptera (18%), and Coleoptera (10%). We found strong regional differences in the phenology of insects and their response to temperature, even within the same taxonomic group, habitat type, and time of season. For example, the biomass of nematoceran flies increased across the season in the central part of the continent, but it only showed a small increase in the Northeast and a seasonal decline in the Southeast and West. At a smaller scale, insect biomass at different traps operating on the same days was correlated up to ~75 km apart. Large‐scale geographic and phenological variation in insect biomass and abundance has not been studied well, and it is a major source of controversy in previous analyses of insect declines that have aggregated studies from different locations and time periods. Our study illustrates that large‐scale predictions about changes in insect populations, and their causes, will need to incorporate regional and taxonomic differences in the response to temperature.","authors":["Jennifer Houtz","Peter O.

Fish oil (FO) is a popular dietary supplement that lowers blood pressure and aortic stiffness. However, the hypothesis that FO supplementation reduces carotid artery stiffness and improves cognitive function in healthy adults requires further investigation. Our objective was to determine the effects of FO supplementation on arterial stiffness and cognitive function in healthy adults. We hypothesized that 6-weeks of FO supplementation would lower arterial stiffness and improve cognitive function. Methods: 25 healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arms intervention to investigate the effects of 6-week FO supplementation (4g/day) on vascular and cognitive function. Aortic stiffness was measured using applanation tonometry and quantified as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and beta-stiffness index (bstiff), and carotid artery stiffness was determined using ultrasonography. Cognitive function was assessed using NIH toolbox cognitive battery. A two-way analysis of variance was used to test differences in treatment groups over time. Results: The mean (± SD) baseline age, body mass index, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure was 40.4 ± 20.6 years, 23.7 ± 2.4 kg/m2, 120.9 ± 14.7 mmHg, and 74.9 ± 12.4 mmHg in the fish oil group and 33.3 ± 14.5 years, 25.3 ± 3.9 kg/m2, 120.8 ± 6.4 mmHg, and 71.9 ± 7.8 mmHg in the placebo group, respectively. Compared to the national averages, our participants scored slightly above average (within one standard deviation) on all tests within the NIH cognitive battery. Within-group comparison revealed no differences in central or peripheral blood pressure, aortic or carotid stiffness, and cognitive function after fish oil supplementation (all p>0.05). Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that in healthy, cognitively normal adults, 6- weeks of FO supplementation does not impact indices of arterial stiffness or cognitive function. Further investigation with more participants and of longer duration is needed to confirm our findings regarding the effects of fish oil supplementation on carotid artery stiffness and cognitive function.\\n\\nThis is the full abstract presented at the American Physiology Summit 2023 meeting and is only available in HTML format.

Multiple jobholders work various combinations of part-time and full-time jobs, which suggests they might spend their time differently than single jobholders, and the second job might affect an individual's subjective well-being. Using data from the 2003-2019 American Time Use Survey, I show that multiple jobholders work and commute more, and spend less time relaxing, sleeping, and doing housework than single jobholders. Overall, multiple jobholders are less likely to report being rested and having a good life relative to single jobholders.

Empathy with a rape victim was examined based on sexual victimization experience, acknowledgment (i.e., labeling experience “sexual assault,” “rape”), and gender.Method Undergraduates (n=531) completed measures of sexual victimization experience and rape empathy.Results Acknowledged victims reported greater empathy than unacknowledged victims and nonvictims, but the latter two groups did not differ. Unacknowledged female victims reported greater empathy than unacknowledged male victims, but no gender difference emerged for acknowledged victims or nonvictims.

Estimated average hospital costs to treat female patients with PJI after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA) in 2018 was $27,307, and $32,956 respectively. While the average costs to treat male patients with PJI after TKA or THA was $27,097 and $33,090 respectively. One strategy aimed at preventing PJI after total joint arthroplasty is the use of an intra-operative wound irrigation with an antiseptic solution. This retrospective case review was conducted to assess the incidence of PJI after using a novel wound antiseptic irrigation solution in patients undergoing primary TKA and THA.\\n\\n## Methods:\\nThe CDC defines surgical site infections, (SSI) as infections that occur after the surgery. The infections are further categorized as superficial involving the skin, or deep tissue. These infections are then divided into; superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ-space SSI. In a study by Kannan et al., SSIs are more commonly seen in patients with more comorbidities. A consecutive series of 308 high-risk patients undergoing primary TKA or THA between January 4, 2021 and August 30, 2021, in whom Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution (B. Braun Medical Inc./ Innovice LLC), containing 0.1% Betaine, a surfactant, and 0.1% Polyhexanide (PHMB) was added to the intra-operative procedure, were evaluated for its impact on the incidence of PJI. The CDC’s Surgical Care Improvement Project, (SCIP) guidelines are standard of care and followed with each surgical procedure. The CDC recommends using antimicrobial prophylaxis at a time before skin incision such that the antibiotic concentration reaches the minimum bactericidal concentration at the time of skin incision, Berríos-Torres SI, et al. All data were prospectively submitted to the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) was retrospectively analyzed to measure the incidence of postoperative infection.\\n\\n## Results:\\nPrimary TJA was performed on 308 patients; of these 10 patients were bilateral TKA (205 TKA procedures and 113 THA procedures). The use of Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution was associated with zero (0%) incidence of postoperative infection in this population of patients during a 90-day episode of care, nor at any time postoperatively. CMS defines total joint arthroplasty codes as a major surgery, and encounters or procedures within 90 days of the initiating procedure are included in the 90-day episode of care. No patients were lost to follow-up.\\n\\n## Conclusion:\\nThere was no incidence of PJI uncovered in this retrospective analysis. Adding Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution to the intra-operative protocol, contributed to the absence of PJI in this population and potentially avoided 1.74 female and 1.34 male TKA as well as .95 female and .75 THA resulting in total hospital-avoided costs of $83,824 and $56,126, respectively totaling $139,950.","authors":["Kristy Olivo","Paul B Jacob","Kevin R Glover","T.

The objective of this research is to provide an empirical examination of the effect of diversification with REITs on the withdrawal of funds from a retirement portfolio. We compare portfolios consisting of large capitalization stocks and corporate bonds to portfolios consisting of large capitalization stocks, corporate bonds, and REITs. We examine both portfolio compositions using a variety of portfolio weights, fund withdrawal rates, and fund withdrawal periods. The results of the study indicate that, in general, portfolios with REITs had a greater likelihood of sustaining a given number of withdrawals over this time. The results of this study can be used for retirement planning since they provide a historical perspective on the success of various withdrawal rates. Our results indicate that REITs, when added to a portfolio of stocks and bonds, can increase the success rates for a withdrawal portfolio.

Commercial drivers have an increased CVD incidence rate of 50% compared to 30% for the general population, yet one third of drivers will not be screened for risk factors due to a lack of insurance or primary care. With approximately 3.5 million commercial drivers nationally and correlation of CVD to increased motor vehicle accidents, fatalities, and excessive healthcare costs, addressing the care gap for this high-risk population is imperative.\\n\\n## Methods:\\nAn evidence-based practice (EBP) project synthesized the literature and implemented CVD risk screening for commercial drivers examined in an occupational practice setting. Using the non-laboratory Framingham CVD risk score calculator, over 90% of drivers were screened during mandated medical examinations and provided education regarding modifiable risk factors during a 2-month period.\\n\\n## Findings:\\nOver 40% of commercial drivers were at high risk for CVD with 25% uninsured and 32% without primary care.

Using this framework, we estimate similarity weights that reflect the birders habit formation and variety seeking preferences. Predicted probabilities from the first stage model are then incorporated into the second stage, a mixed logit recreation site choice model of bird watching trips from eBird, by their members. We find that including the dynamic elements of choice, specifically variety‐seeking behavior, can double the estimated willingness to pay (WTP) for individual sites relative to the static model. Although our sample of bird watching trips taken by eBird members is a sample of convenience, these results suggest that static models of recreation site choice are a lower bound on our recreation demand WTP estimates.

In this study, we explore hand preference in wild crab‐eating tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) inhabiting a mangrove forest located on the coastal area of Northeast Brazil (Maranhão State). Tufted capuchin monkeys at our site use facultatively wooden tools to crack open crabs. We observed hand preference in 12 subjects who spontaneously participated in experiment sessions, in which we provided crabs and tools on wooden platforms. We recorded (using events and bouts) two unimanual tasks, (tool or crab) grabbing and (tool or crab) pounding, and one bimanual task, crab pulling, where one hand kept the crab in place while the other pulled off parts of the crab. Hand preference increased with greater strength needed to perform the task and its complexity. While only 17%−25% of capuchins showed hand preference during grabbing, 44%−64% showed hand preference during pounding, and most subjects 64%−80% displayed a right‐hand preference when performing the bimanual task, for which all lateralized individuals were right‐handed. Hand preference did not vary between adults and juvenile individuals and was not consistent across tasks. Group‐level hand preference was found only for the bimanual task, for which all lateralized individuals were right‐handed. Our findings are in concordance with those of other primate studies showing the emergence of hemispheric specialization for bimanual actions, highlight the importance of conducting such studies on diverse type of tasks, and show the feasibility to conduct experimental manipulation under natural conditions.","authors":["Kristie Le","Daiana P.

Investigations into specific behaviors and practices that influence arterial stiffness has been a priority in the past few years . Chronic aerobic and anaerobic exercise activity has consistently shown to attenuate or not influence markers of arterial stiffness in adults with chronic disease and otherwise healthy adults. Chronic high functional resistance training’s effect on vascular compliance is less understood.\\nPURPOSE: To determine the effects of a chronic high functional resistance training program on pulse wave velocity and beta-stiffness index.\\nMETHODS: Participants (18-40 years old) were placed in a non-randomized fashion into high functional resistance training (HFRT) group (n = 9; >6 months of CrossFit experience; 4 female), or control (CON) group (n = 8; < 6 months of exercise experience; 6 female). Participants in the HFRT group trained at the same local facility 4 -5 days a week, utilizing the same training program. CON group refrained from exercise during the study period. Body composition, 1,000 meter rowing test, deadlift 1 repetition maximum (1 RM), hemodynamic assessments and vascular compliance was assessed at baseline and follow-up. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine within and between interactions on indices of arterial stiffness.\\nRESULTS: There were baseline differences between groups in deadlift 1 RM (72.3 ± 18.2 kg mean difference (MD), p < 0.01), rowing time (143.8 ± 35.7 sec MD, p < 0.01), and rowing average watts (153.8 ± 34.6 watts MD, p < 0.01).

The impact of this type of training on arterial stiffness is less understood.\\n\\n**PURPOSE**: To investigate the acute effects of autoregulated (AR) and non-autoregulated (NAR) BFR exercise on indices of arterial stiffness. AR BFR training devices adjust pressure in the cuff ensuring similar pressure throughout the range of motion when the muscles are contracted (dilatated) and relaxed. NAR BFR training devices do not adjust pressure in the cuff throughout the range of motion when the muscles are contracted and relaxed which cause greater pressures at different points in the range of motion.\\n\\n**METHODS**: Following a randomized AR or NAR familiarization training session, 20 adults (23 ± 5 years; 7 female) participated in 3 randomized treatment-order sessions with AR-BFR, NAR-BFR, and no-BFR separated by 1-week washout periods. Participants performed 4 sets of dumbbell wall squats to failure using 20% of 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) at 2-second concentric/eccentric cadence. Pneumatic straps were placed around the proximal portion of each thigh and training limb occlusion pressure (LOP) was set at 60% of supine LOP for both the AT and NAR sessions. Testing before and immediately following the training session included ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, and blood pressure acquisition. Two-way ANOVAs were used to examine the effects of treatment and the treatment-order interaction on pulse wave velocity (PWV), beta-stiffness index (β-stiff), and arterial compliance (AC).\\n\\n**RESULTS**: There were no baseline differences in CF- (carotid-femoral) PWV, CR- (carotid-radial) PWV, β-stiff, and AC (all p > 0.05). CF-PWV increased in the NAR-BFR (mean difference = 0.57 ± 1.12 m/s, p = 0.02) and no-BFR (mean difference = 0.63 ± 1.42 m/s, p = 0.03) groups following the exercise session. CR-PWV increased in the no-BFR (mean difference = 0.82 ± 1.5 m/s, p = 0.03) group. And there was an interaction effect in CF-PWV between AR-BFR and NAR-BFR (mean difference = 0.70 ± 1.6 m/s, p = 0.03).\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**: These findings show acute AR-BFR training does not influence indices of arterial stiffness while acute NAR-BFR training increases central stiffness.\\n\\nCopyright © 2023 by the American College of Sports Medicine","authors":["Tim Werner","Nicholas Licameli","Masoud Moghaddam","Lisa Marquette","Nicholas Rolnick","Brent Fedorko","Jessica Walter"],"journal":"Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise","datePublished":"2023-9","aiKeywords":["Arterial Stiffness","Exercise Prescription","Blood Flow Restriction Exercise","Acute Effects of Exercise"],"facultyKeywords":["Biochemistry","Health medical physics","Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology","Biochemistry and molecular biology","Biophysics","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Physiology, general","Health sciences, general","Public health","Public health, general","Health sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Molecular biology","Health sciences, other","Exercise science and kinesiology","Exercise physiology and kinesiology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1249/01.mss.0000980200.41641.da","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1249/01.mss.0000981168.98351.fb","type":"paper","title":"Comparison Of Autoregulated And Non-Autoregulated Blood Flow Restriction Training On Acute Muscular Morphological Adaptations","abstract":"C - 05 Blood Flow Restriction Comparison Of Autoregulated And Non-Autoregulated Blood Flow Restriction Training On Acute Muscular Morphological Adaptations\\n460 Moghaddam, Masoud 1; Rolnick, Nicholas D. 2; Licameli, Nicholas M. 3; Marquette, Lisa M. 4; Walter, Jessica M. 4; Fedorko, Brent F. 4; Werner, Tim J.

A-BFR cuff pressure was automatically adjusted throughout the range of motion as muscle contracting. NA-BFR devices did not adjust the pressure in the cuff for muscle contraction.\\nMETHODS: Following a randomized familiarization, 20 adults (23 ± 5 years; 7 females) participated in 3 randomized treatment-order sessions with A-BFR, NA-BFR, and no BFR separated by 1-week washout periods. Participants performed four sets of wall squats to failure using 20% of 1-RM at 2-sec concentric/eccentric cadence and 1 min recovery between sets. Participants wore BFR cuffs at 60% of supine limb occlusion pressure (LOP) on top of their thighs. VL cross-sectional area (CSA) and echo intensity (EI) were assessed via ultrasound before and after each session. The scans were captured in the transverse plane at the mid-thigh of the right leg. Two-way ANOVAs were used for statistical analysis.\\nRESULTS: No significant time × treatment interaction (p > 0.05) was observed. However, there were significant main effects of treatment for CSA (p = 0.016) and EI (p = 0.019). Post hoc analyses showed significant differences between A-BFR and NA-BFR, while there were no other significant differences between treatments. Furthermore, significant main effects of time were observed in CSA (p = 0.000) and EI (p = 0.001). All treatments significantly (p < 0.05) increased CSA (A-BFR: 27.4 ± 6.8 to 29.7 ± 7.2 cm2, α%: 7.9 ± 3.3; NA-BFR: 27.8 ± 6.9 to 30.3 ± 7.3 cm2, α%: 8.5 ± 2.3; no BFR: 27.6 ± 6.7 to 29.8 ± 7.0 cm2, α%: 7.4 ± 3.4) and EI (A-BFR: 65.3 ± 10.5 to 67.5 ± 10.5 au, α%: 3.3 ± 4.9; NA-BFR: 68.6 ± 10.2 to 73.5 ± 11.0 au, α%: 6.1 ± 9.0; no BFR: 67.6 ± 9.6 to 70.8 ± 10.9 au, α%: 4.1 ± 6.6).\\nCONCLUSION: Low-load resistance exercise to failure induces acute muscle swelling regardless of BFR. However, NA-BFR significantly increased CSA and EI compared to A-BFR. Since EI is inversely related to muscle quality, these findings suggest that autoregulated pressure in A-BFR can cause a lower fluid flux to the intracellular space and possibly less muscle damage and swelling than NA-BFR.

The algorithm is structurally based on the Parallel Iterative Improvement (PII) Algorithm, which successfully finds a stable matching in approximately 90% of cases.

We also suggest the Right-Minimum selection method, leading to an algorithm which converges in approximately 99.9% of cases and can be combined with the PII-SC algorithm's cycle detection and Gale-Shapley Initiation to remove all cycles observed thus far.\\n\\nIndex Terms\\nPoster: Dynamic and NM1-Right Selection for the Parallel Iterative Improvement Stable Matching Algorithm\\nTheory of computation\\nDesign and analysis of algorithms\\nParallel algorithms\\n\\nPublished In\\nMobiHoc '23: Proceedings of the Twenty-fourth International Symposium on Theory, Algorithmic Foundations, and Protocol Design for Mobile Networks and Mobile Computing\\nOctober 2023\\n\\nContributors\\nAlec Kyritsis, Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont, USA\\nScott Wynn, University of Washington, Seattle, Seattle, Washington, United States of America\\nStephora Cesar Alberi, Salisbury University, Salisbury, Maryland, USA\\nEnyue Lu, Salisbury University, Salisbury, Maryland, United States of America\\n\\nCopyright © 2023 Owner/Author(s).

Social capital theory suggests that better health outcomes may result from certain “neighborly” aspects of social capital.\\n\\n## Methods:\\nThis study used secondary data from the Social Capital Index. Bivariate correlations were calculated between neighborly social capital and health outcome variables. Next, neighborly social capital variables were entered as predictors of health outcomes in a series of stepwise regressions. Regional comparisons were conducted across four U.S. regions. Comparisons of the regression model structures were conducted by applying a model derived from one region to the data from another region and contrasting the resulting crossed R2 with the original direct R2 to identify differential regression weights across the four regions that warrant interpretation.\\n\\n## Results:\\nThe correlation and regression analyses showed significant negative relationships between three neighborly social capital variables (% who do favors for their neighbors, % who worked with neighbors to improve something, and % who trust all or most of their neighbors) and health outcomes including: % in fair/poor health, premature mortality rate, % diabetic, and % obese. In regional comparisons, only the South region had a direct and crossed R2 significantly different from other regions, with this difference largely attributable to an unexpected positive relationship between trusting neighbors and negative health outcomes in the South.\\n\\n## Conclusions:\\nInterventions to increase neighborly social capital may help to alleviate negative health outcomes in the U.S. Anomalously, in the South, trusting neighbors may be related to worse health outcomes.\\n\\n## Key messages:\\n• Being neighborly may enhance positive health outcomes in most parts of the U.S.\\n\\n• Strong social support impacts urban health.","authors":["J E Kost","C B Neck","S A Maykrantz","J D Houghton"],"journal":"European Journal of Public Health","datePublished":"2023-10-24","aiKeywords":["Social capital and health outcomes","Neighborly interactions and health","Regional disparities in health outcomes","Importance of social support in urban health contexts"],"facultyKeywords":["Social sciences","Sociology, general","Environmental health","Public policy analysis","Public health","Public health, general","Public policy analysis, general","Health sciences","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Health policy analysis","Sociology, demography, and population studies"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckad160.1167","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1080/03630242.2023.2272203","type":"paper","title":"Sexual victimization by current partner is negatively associated with women’s sexual satisfaction","abstract":"Lower sexual satisfaction with one’s current partner (SSCP) has been associated with having a history of sexual victimization experience (SVE). However, whether or not this SVE involved the current partner as the perpetrator has been unclear. This study aimed to address this gap in the sexual health literature by examining women’s SSCP based on SVE with that current partner (yes; no) and/or a different perpetrator (yes; no). A convenience sample of undergraduate women with an exclusive current partner (n=412; 99 percent unmarried) at a U.S. public university anonymously responded via paper-and-pencil to the Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization between 2012–2016. A 2×2 ANOVA revealed that current-partner SVE was associated with lower SSCP (F (1, 410)=7.38, p=.007, partial n2=.018), but other-perpetrator SVE was not. SVE may predict lower SSCP when victimized by that partner, as that partner may be associated with the negative victimization experience. Although preliminary, findings highlight the importance of considering how partner-related health factors (e.g. SSCP) may be differentially associated with SVE based on whether or not the victim’s current partner was the perpetrator.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: Current, partner, satisfaction, sexual victimization\\n\\nDisclosure statement\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\\n\\nAdditional information\\nFunding\\nThe author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.","authors":["Suzanne L.

As such, it has been cited as indicative of dietary specialization among fossil taxa, although it remains unknown how variable zygomatic arch root position is among living primates, and whether its positioning predicts differences in diet. We test whether primates that consume more mechanically challenging foods possess more anteriorly positioned zygomatic roots compared to those consuming less challenging foods. Zygomatic root position, as defined by the zygomaxillare landmark, was identified and recorded from digital images and physical specimens of adult primate crania. Data were collected from 33 haplorhine species (n= 722). Published data were used to assign species to a dietary type based on patterns of overall consumption along with reliance on especially challenging foods. Pairwise comparisons between mechanically challenging (hard and/or tough) and less mechanically challenging (soft) consumers found significant differences (p< 0.05) in the position of the zygomatic root in 17 of 20 pairs, 11 of which supported the prediction that a more mechanically challenging diet is associated with a more anteriorly placed zygomatic root. PGLS analysis found no significant effect of phylogeny on root position. This suggests that a more anteriorly positioned zygomatic root is useful for identifying dietary specialization in some taxa but is not required for consuming a mechanically challenging diet given that other craniofacial and behavioral factors can facilitate the consumption of such foods.","authors":["Irene E.

One prevailing perspective is that slacktivism, a tendency of online supporters to provide only token support, undermines any possible impact. An alternative perspective is that social media dynamics underlying digital activism offer new pathways for social activists to pressure firms toward social change. To explore this debate, we combine insights from research on social movements, social media, and the logic of connective action to theorize the impact of social media mechanisms such as e‐petition connectivity and velocity. With a hand‐coded database of 1587 e‐petitions targeting Fortune 500 firms from 2012 to 2017 through the platformChange.org, we empirically evaluate whether these e‐petitions matter. Our empirical results strongly suggest that e‐petitions do matter, and we explain when digital activism has impact. The activation of social media mechanisms spreads negative information and directly intensifies the threat to the targeted firm's reputation, pressuring firms to concede to e‐petitioner demands. Furthermore, our findings indicate that firm visibility and resource availability can represent boundary conditions for the firm's vulnerability and ability to respond to digital activism.","authors":["Michelle Westermann‐Behaylo","Kathleen Rehbein","Elise Perrault","Ronei Leonel"],"journal":"Journal of Management Studies","datePublished":"2023-10-18","aiKeywords":["e-petitions","slacktivism","firm responsiveness","corporate social responsibility","digital activism","social media dynamics"],"facultyKeywords":["Business","Social sciences","Political science and government","Business administration and management","Social sciences, other","Sociology, general","Political science and government, general","Social sciences nec","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","International relations and national security studies","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Organizational leadership","Business management and administration"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joms.13010","licenseUrl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1177/15248399231206085","type":"paper","title":"Understanding Libraries as Part of the Rural Active Living Environment: Evidence From a Content Analysis of Library Facebook Posts Made in Summer 2022","abstract":"As both public health and public libraries continue to evolve, there are opportunities for collaboration focused on building policies, systems, and environments that support communities making healthy choices easy choices. Given the health disparities related to physical inactivity, such as diabetes and heart disease in rural America, public libraries within rural communities are emerging as important settings for health promotion and disease prevention. This study sought to better understand how rural libraries promote physical activity opportunities on Facebook. Based on a content analysis of Facebook posts of a random sample of 118 libraries made during the Summer of 2022, 47 of the 118 had at least one post related to physical activity and 42 had multiple posts. The most frequent offering was events or classes; libraries also supported physical activity by lending equipment and making changes to the built environment. This study provides evidence that some rural libraries are offering physical activity opportunities through community health partnerships, particularly for youth and families. Considering this evidence, public health professionals are encouraged to collaborate with local libraries to promote physical activity and advance rural health equity. Researchers are invited to continue to develop the evidence base around promoting physical activity with rural libraries.","authors":["Sandra Slater","Noah Lenstra","Cynthia Perry","Andrew C.

Hoover spent over a year in Australia as a mining engineer before launching a career in international business, food relief, and politics. In 1942, LBJ passed part of his pre-presidential career in Australia. Yet Johnson’s presidential tour in 1966, coupled with his return in 1967, generated massive enthusiasm and modest protests against the Vietnam War. President Johnson’s visits helped to solidify and celebrate US-Australian ties while encouraging Australian independence, even if during a war directed from Washington. While Hoover left his mark on Australia’s landscape in the mines he promoted and the sites that still stand, Australians found little appealing in the dour, Depression-era president who had come and gone without regarding their country as a friend or ally. Johnson thus became a consequential figure in Australia’s national history in ways Hoover never did.\\n\\n## Acknowledgments\\nThe author presented early versions of this article at the European Association for Studies of Australia conference in 2023 and at Bruce Hall, the Australian National University in 2022.

Historically, film criticism has cast montage in one of several roles: as narrative’s invisible executor of spatiotemporal continuity to maintain the viewer’s investment in the story-world; as an agent of disorder that confounds conventions of storytelling and realism and prompts the viewer’s intellectual engagement; and as an expressionistic device for augmenting the duration and combination of shots to affect viewers at a sensory level. While not exactly abandoning such accounts, this study tries to move closer to the heart of montage by distinguishing the space between images as itself a powerful source of ideas, feelings, and forms. Venturing into an “expanded field of montage” beyond the limited purview of a given film’s “editing,” Between Images traces the cut and the splice across photographic and cinematic media in a range of material, conceptual, and political contexts. In all of this, the space between images becomes a setting for navigating and renegotiating the terms of relation, of the “being-with” that connects all forms of life. Between Images brings together a diverse cast of experimental filmmakers, including Harun Farocki, Hito Steyerl, Steve McQueen, Cauleen Smith, Daïchi Saito, and Ja’Tovia Gary, and in doing so, situates the cinematic cut within an interdisciplinary conversation about the abiding capacity of cinema to effect change.","authors":["Ryan Conrath"],"journal":"","datePublished":"2023-11-23","aiKeywords":["theory of montage","interdisciplinary dialogue","human relations","space between images","material and conceptual contexts","cinema's transformative potential"],"facultyKeywords":["Humanities","Philosophy and religious studies","Philosophy","Dance, drama, theatre arts and stagecraft","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Performing arts","Interdisciplinary computer sciences","Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Visual and performing arts","Visual arts, media studies, and design","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Film, cinema, and media studies","Musicology and ethnomusicology","Humanities, other","Humanities and humanistic studies","Philosophy and religious studies nec","Theological and ministerial studies","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780197612293.001.0001","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1177/1086296x231215759","type":"paper","title":"Rural Women, Creative Writing, and Resistance","abstract":"Blending narrative portraiture and feminist methods, this study explored the lives of two rural women who are creative writers.

They ranged from interrogating societal perspectives of gender, sexuality, and race to interrogating rurality and sexual violence.

The use of anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, and muscle relaxants increased significantly linearly over time (all P &lt; .005).\\n\\n## Conclusion:\\nThere has been a downward trend in the use of opioids in recent years among pediatric patients with cancer and an upward trend in the use of non-opioid pharmacotherapy for pain management potentially as an alternative to opioids.","authors":["Eric Schaefer","Ning Li","J Douglas Thornton","Chan Shen","Shouhao Zhou","Douglas Leslie","Sarah Kawasaki","Colette Pameijer"],"journal":"The Oncologist","datePublished":"2023-11-7","aiKeywords":["Non-opioid pharmacotherapy","Pediatric cancer treatment","Opioid use trends","Pain management strategies"],"facultyKeywords":["Pharmacology and toxicology","Health services research","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Pharmaceutical sciences","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology nec","Pharmacology","Public health","Public health, general","Pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences","Health sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Toxicology","Oncology and cancer biology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oncolo/oyad292","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1093/geroni/igad104.2113","type":"paper","title":"DEVELOPMENT OF TWO GERIATRIC CASES TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE NEXT-GENERATION RN LICENSING EXAM","abstract":"With the implementation of the Next Generation NCLEX-RN (NGN) national licensing examination in April of 2023, faculty in state of Maryland nursing schools were solicited for participation in a Maryland Nursing Workforce Center grant initiative to develop a repository of NGN case studies. A major change in the exam was the integration of a six-step clinical judgment model using a case-based format with client information presented in an electronic medical record using new question types designated for each of the steps presented sequentially. Twenty faculty “champions” from 13 Maryland schools attended several training sessions and were to develop two peer-reviewed cases for inclusion in the Qualtrics database. Once approved, these cases could then be accessed online via a secure link or QR code by Maryland-based nursing faculty and shared with students for instructional and practice purposes. Two gero-focused cases were developed. The first case focused on an older adult in a long-term care facility admitted to the hospital for a urinary tract infection with potential complication of urosepsis. Another featured a hospitalized older adult client with Alzheimer’s disease admitted from home with dehydration with potential for delirium superimposed on dementia. While a major objective of this innovative and proactive state-wide initiative is to optimize success on the modified NCLEX-RN, it is also hoped that these case examples, when appropriately integrated into the nursing curriculum, will enhance understanding of common geriatric scenarios and better prepare graduates for safe, effective nursing care of older adults.","authors":["Mary DiBartolo"],"journal":"Innovation in Aging","datePublished":"2023-12-21","aiKeywords":["Clinical judgment in nursing","Geriatric care","Case-based learning","Nursing education","NCLEX-RN exam preparation"],"facultyKeywords":["Nursing science","Teacher education, specific subject areas","Education research","Nursing and nursing science","Curriculum and instruction","Health sciences, general","Education research nec","Medical clinical science","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Health sciences","Nursing specialties and practice","Education","Teacher education","Health sciences, other","Nursing education","Special education and teaching","Higher education evaluation and research"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igad104.2113","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1080/15313204.2023.2291658","type":"paper","title":"Epistemic ethics justice: a “radical imaginary”","abstract":"In the context of the Great Challenges for Social Work, this conceptual paper envisions a “radical imaginary” as a call to action to incrementally build an epistemically just ethics infrastructure in the coming decade that centers race, ethnicity, and culture.

This book adopts multiple perspectives on why films matter within and beyond the classroom, with special attention to hearing the sound tracks that move through bodies and that can be carried into the world at large. Drawing on work by authors across disparate fields of literature, business, psychology, biological science, autobiography, history, and cultural studies, this book makes the case for cinema as a life force on the biggest emotional, personal, and social terms, and in ways that can resonate for any reader. The book zeroes in on cinema that offers hope in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement (Imitation of Life (1959) and BlacKkKlansman (2018)); contemporary feminism (Nobody Knows (2004)); the teachings of Heartmath (Dancer in the Dark (2000)); realities of grief and mourning (Life of Pi (2012), Ikiru (1952), and A Star Is Born (2018)); and personal experiences of loss (Call Me By Your Name (2017) and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)).

Neither pair was observed nesting prior to or following this event, and all chicks are believed to have been lost to predation.

Researchers of this study posed the question: How has the pandemic impacted those who serve to help others? Seven aspects of self-efficacy in professional practice were examined via an online survey sent to health educators. Respondents were extremely confident communicating with their colleagues and supervisors (60%) and with students (51%), but only 19% were extremely confident in maintaining a work-life balance and 22% in managing personal and professional stress. Respondents reported being confident in all areas of responsibilities, overall, but they were most confident in Area 8 (ethics and professionalism) and least confident in Area 1 (assessing the needs and capacity of a community) since COVID-19. Findings imply a need for more professional development opportunities to foster professional and personal self-efficacy and to improve self-efficacy in needs assessment, leadership, and advocacy.

Despite the important role parents play in TGNC youth’s development, there is little research on their experiences. This study explored the early parenting experiences of 34 parents of pre-adolescent TGNC youth. Parents were recruited from online communities and listservs, and interviewed via phone about their early parenting experiences. Data were analyzed via thematic analysis. Findings indicate that parents became aware of their child’s TGNC identity either through observing their child’s gender behaviors, or by their child verbalizing their identity. Parents, on average, became aware of their child’s gender identity exploration when they were just over 3 and a half years old. Parents felt a mix of emotions, with many reporting a lack of concern or positive emotions regarding their child’s rejection of traditional gender roles. Parents without prior knowledge of transgender people or existing connections to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+) people sought out information from the Internet. The findings are both consistent with and diverge from prior research with parents, suggesting both new areas for research, and additional ways in which TGNC youth and their parents can be best supported.\\n\\nKeywords: Transgender, children, parenting, gender identity\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\nThank you to the participants who were willing to share their stories with us, to Abbey Hamburg, Claire Howard, Audriana Holstein, Alexis Pritchard, Deija Spencer, Juliet Vaspva, and Celeste Welsh for their assistance on this project, and to the anonymous reviewers who provided feedback on prior versions of this manuscript.\\n\\nDisclosure statement\\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\\n\\nFunding Notes\\n1 The term “TGNC” is used for both consistency with prior literature and with the interview questions used in this project.

If we are to significantly slow these losses, the attention and resources devoted to individual causes should be commensurate with the magnitude of their contribution to the problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative magnitude of five major threats to species identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened with extinction. Specifically, we analyzed the entire IUCN Red List database to determine the percentage of threatened species affected by overexploitation, climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, and invasive species, diseases, and genes. We also randomly sampled a portion of the database to estimate the percentage of species for which each threat was the dominant threat placing them at risk of extinction. Of the 20,784 species for which data were available, 88.3% were impacted by habitat destruction, 26.6% by overexploitation, 25% by invasives, 18.2% by pollution, and 16.8% by climate change and weather. Focusing on dominant threats, the percentage of species for which a given threat was the main factor pushing them toward extinction was as follows: habitat destruction 71.3%, overexploitation 7.4%, invasives 6.8%, pollution 4.7%, climate change, and weather 1.8%. Regardless of how percentages are calculated, habitat destruction threatens more species than all other categories combined, climate change the fewest. From the perspective of species and biodiversity conservation, these data suggest that a significant change in global environmental priorities is needed. Habitat destruction should become a greater focus of global environmental efforts and receive the attention and resources appropriate to the extraordinary magnitude of its impact. Moreover, while it is important to address all environmental problems, given the disproportionate impact habitat destruction has on species, care should be taken to avoid solutions to other problems that exacerbate this destruction.","authors":["Aaron S.

Sexual minority (SM) adults are less likely to have access to primary care services than their heterosexual counterparts. Additionally, access to health services among SM persons can vary by age. One plausible explanation for these disparities are experiences of minority stress. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the association between experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services among SM people in the United States across multiple age cohorts. A series of logistic regressions examined associations among multiple experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services. Analyses, stratified by age cohort, examined associations between experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services. Felt stigma, on average, was negatively associated with having a primary care provider among the full sample. The stratified analysis revealed that higher rates of felt stigma were negatively associated with having a primary care provider only among younger SM adults. This study offers novel information suggesting that unique experiences of minority stress are linked with barriers in access to primary care services among SM people.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Sexual minority adults, primary care services, minority stress\\n\\n**Disclosure statement** No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\\n\\n**Additional information** Funding Generations is funded by a grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD grant 1R01HD078526) and through supplemental grants from the National Institutes of Health, Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, and the Office of Research on Women’s Health.

Our findings show that there is no difference in the effect of statistical versus narrative messages on message believability when the recipient of the message is in abstract mindset. However, when the recipient is in concrete mindset, statistical messages lead to stronger believability perceptions.

Surface or mound treatment using contact insecticide is one of the main methods to controlS. invicta. In the present study, cycloxaprid, a newly discovered neonicotinoid insecticide, was evaluated forS. invictacontrol and compared with two referent insecticides, imidacloprid and bifenthrin.\\n\\n## RESULTS:\\nSurfaces or sand treated with cycloxaprid, imidacloprid, or bifenthrin caused high mortality ofS. invictaworkers, and the action of cycloxaprid or imidacloprid was slower than bifenthrin. Like imidacloprid and bifenthrin, cycloxaprid can be horizontally transferred from corpses or live donor ants to recipient ants. In addition, cycloxaprid‐ or imidacloprid‐treated surfaces significantly induced the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and detoxification enzymes; nevertheless, they had no significant effect on the foraging behaviors ofS. invictaworkers. Also, sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid did not negatively affect the digging activities of ants. Interestingly,S. invictaworkers excavated significantly more sand containing 0.01 mg/kg cycloxaprid than untreated sand in the no‐choice digging bioassays. In addition, extensive nesting activities (sand excavation and stacking) were observed in the flowerpots containing untreated sand or sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid. On the contrary, bifenthrin significantly reduced the foraging, digging, and nesting activities ofS. invictaworkers.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION:\\nCycloxaprid is a slow‐acting and nonrepellent insecticide againstS. invictaworkers, and its contact and horizontal toxicities are slightly higher than imidacloprid. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.","authors":["Lang Zhang","Jiacheng Cai","Xuan Chen","Jian Chen","Yinghao He","Yongyue Lu","Lei Wang","Cai Wang","Jianlong Zhang","Xiujun Wen","Zhiping Xu"],"journal":"Pest Management Science","datePublished":"2022-3-7","aiKeywords":["Environmental impact of insecticides","Ant behavior and activity","Pest control strategies","Comparative analysis of insecticides","Insecticide efficacy"],"facultyKeywords":["Pharmacology and toxicology","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences nec","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences","Pharmacology","Food science and technology","Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Biological and biomedical sciences","Microbiology, general","Microbiology and immunology","Toxicology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6847","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1093/mnras/stac590","type":"paper","title":"Stellar multiplicity and stellar rotation: insights from APOGEE","abstract":"We measure rotational broadening in spectra taken by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey to characterize the relationship between stellar multiplicity and rotation. We create a sample of 2786 giants and 24 496 dwarfs with stellar parameters and multiple radial velocities from the APOGEE pipeline, projected rotation speeds vsin i determined from our own pipeline, and distances, masses, and ages measured by Sanders & Das. We use the statistical distribution of the maximum shift in the radial velocities, ΔRVmax, as a proxy for the close binary fraction to explore the interplay between stellar evolution, rotation, and multiplicity. Assuming that the minimum orbital period allowed is the critical period for Roche Lobe overflow and rotational synchronization, we calculate theoretical upper limits on expected vsin i and ΔRVmax values. These expectations agree with the positive correlation between the maximum ΔRVmax and vsin i values observed in our sample as a function of log(g). We find that the fast rotators in our sample have a high occurrence of short-period [log(P/d) ≲ 4] companions. We also find that old, rapidly rotating main-sequence stars have larger completeness-corrected close binary fractions than their younger peers. Furthermore, rapidly rotating stars with large ΔRVmax consistently show differences of 1–10 Gyr between the predicted gyrochronological and measured isochronal ages. These results point towards a link between rapid rotation and close binarity through tidal interactions. We conclude that stellar rotation is strongly correlated with stellar multiplicity in the field, and caution should be taken in the application of gyrochronology relations to cool stars.","authors":["Jesús Hernández","Carles Badenes","Kaitlin Kratter","Nathan De Lee","Nicholas W Troup","Guy S Stringfellow","Marc Pinsonneault","Don Dixon","Keivan G Stassun","Matthew G Walker","Maxwell Moe","Diego Godoy-Rivera","Javier Serna","Borja Anguiano","Joleen K Carlberg","Christine Mazzola Daher","Christian Nitschelm","Steven Majewski","Rachel Buttry","Jamie Tayar","Sergey E Koposov"],"journal":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","datePublished":"2022-3-4","aiKeywords":["Stellar multiplicity","Stellar evolution","Gyrochronology","Binary star systems","Stellar rotation","Tidal interactions"],"facultyKeywords":["Physical sciences","Climatology, atmospheric chemistry and physics","Geology","Geochemistry","Physics and astronomy","Condensed matter and materials physics","Physics","Ocean marine sciences and atmospheric science","Geophysics and seismology","Astronomy and astrophysics","Geological and earth sciences nec","Atmospheric sciences and meteorology nec","Astrophysics","Geology earth science, general","Hydrology and water resources science","Geological and earth sciences","Geosciences, atmospheric, and ocean sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac590","licenseUrl":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model"},{"id":"10.1080/24711616.2020.1866471","type":"paper","title":"Wellness Improvements Following a 15-Week Lifelong Fitness and Wellness Class","abstract":"Wellness behaviors enacted during the college years may have long-term impacts on adult health; as such, it is critical that college students be educated regarding health behaviors and ways to improve their wellness. One way to educate students in reference to improved health practices is through college/university instructional physical activity programs that include a didactic wellness component. Limited research is available on the impact that courses of this nature have on student wellness outcomes. To assess the impact of a 15-week fitness and wellness course on perceived wellness in emerging adults, a convenience sample of undergraduate students (N = 334) enrolled in a general education Lifelong Fitness and Wellness class completed an instrument consisting of the Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS), the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3), and demographic questions at the beginning and end of the Fall 2018 semester. Data were collected using a web-based survey administered through a password-protected Qualtrics account. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the goodness of fit of participants’ responses on the PWS to the proposed model and then the data were analyzed using a pretest/posttest statistical design. Mixed analyses of covariance revealed improvements in overall wellness, emotional wellness, and physical wellness from pretest to posttest with no impact on lecture delivery mode or activity participation type.

In this article, we reflect on JSDSE’s relevance to K-12 education and how it might increase its influence in this area. We characterize JSDSE’s K-12 impact partially in terms of its ability to foster statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). We also introduce a new construct, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT2), to more fully capture the K-12 contributions JSDSE can make. Our analysis draws upon the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher (the first author) and a statistics education researcher (the second author). The first author of the article surveyed recent JSDSE issues to identify and reflect upon articles with implications for his teaching practice. The second author framed the first author’s article reflections in terms of their connections to SKT and SKT2. Drawing upon our collaborative analysis, we propose strategies to help JSDSE more fully realize its potential to contribute to SKT and SKT2. We explain how acting on the proposed strategies may help JSDSE readers, authors, and editors bridge the persistent historical gap between formal scholarship and practice in K-12 education.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: Assessment, Curriculum, Education, Pedagogical content knowledge, Professional development, Statistical knowledge for teaching\\n\\n1  Introduction\\nThe Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education (JSDSE) has a long history of making scholarly work accessible to a wide audience. As the journal was founded, Arnold (Citation1993) stated that it was “intended to be international in scope, dedicated to improving all postsecondary statistics education, and crossing both disciplinary and national borders” (n. p.). The intended audience encompassed those teaching “pure” statistics as well as those teaching statistics in various disciplines such as psychology, economics, and biology. As the journal grew, efforts to expand its reach grew as well. For example, in 2007, a new department, “From Research to Practice,” was established to encourage conversations about using research to inform teaching. The journal’s readers were invited to craft submissions by “finding a research article of interest, reading and reflecting on it, implementing ideas from the paper in their classes, assessing the results, writing up their findings, and submitting it” (Miller Citation2007, n. p.). Another new department, “Research on K-12 Statistics Education,” was later established to encourage study of precollege teaching and learning of statistics (Jacobbe Citation2013). Although the journal’s original intended audience was those teaching college-level statistics, it has expanded to include K-12 issues. The journal’s efforts to expand its K-12 content and connect research to practice, along with the fact that it is freely available online, make it a potentially powerful catalyst to help improve K-12 teaching and learning.\\n\\n2  Purpose\\nIn this article, we aim to support JSDSE’s goal of improving K-12 statistics education by reflecting on the journal’s current and potential impact in this area. Our reflections draw upon our backgrounds in K-12 education and statistics education research. The first author of this article is a high school teacher. When the article was written, he had 7 years of teaching experience at a rural high school of approximately 500–600 students and had taught AP Statistics each year to classes ranging between 10 and 25 students in size. He also had served as an official AP Statistics exam scorer. The second author is a university faculty member and researcher in the field of statistics education. He has investigated the nature and importance of statistical knowledge for teaching and has published such work in JSDSE and in other venues. Collectively, our reflections highlight directions JSDSE has taken, and may be able to take in the future, to publish content addressing the needs of K-12 statistics teachers.\\n\\n3  Method\\nA reading response journal (Lee Citation2008) constructed during a 5-week independent study course provided the initial collaboration space for the reflections reported in this article. The second author, who served as course instructor, elicited the first author’s initial impressions of JSDSE by asking him to browse recent volumes of the journal and select articles with relevance to his teaching practice. Each week, the first author selected three articles from a volume of JSDSE published within the past five years, initially attending to articles with value for teaching AP Statistics. As the first author carried out this task, he wrote reflections on how each selected article could inform his practice and uploaded the reflections to an online course management system. The second author then wrote detailed feedback on the first author’s journal entries to prompt additional reflection on implications for statistics education. Providing such feedback on written journal entries can be a powerful technique to foster and deepen reflection (Pieper et al. Citation2021). At the end of each week of the course, the two authors met to discuss the reflections and feedback. These discussions helped identify additional possible implications for teaching AP Statistics and K-12 education in general. A subjectively chosen sample of 15 articles was discussed using this process. We note that our overall goal was not to conduct an exhaustive review of journal content, but rather to identify some articles that may be most salient to a teacher encountering the journal for the first time and to reflect on the professional development value of those articles. We believed that focusing on articles that initially stood out the most to a practicing teacher would be valuable because the internet contains an overwhelming amount of both high-quality and low-quality material competing for teachers’ attention. To make an impact, high-quality online material like that offered in JSDSE must capture readers’ attention. Individuals tend to skim and scan webpages for information relevant to specific tasks and questions they have, and they quickly move on if they do not find content of interest and relevance (Redish Citation2007). First impressions are hence important objects of study when assessing the impact of online material. As we discussed the first author’s initial impressions of JSDSE content, the second author recognized some aspects of JSDSE’s potential to enhance readers’ statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). SKT is not common disciplinary knowledge of statistics alone; it also includes pedagogical content knowledge, which helps one make subject matter comprehensible to students (Shulman Citation1987; Groth Citation2013). Along with SKT connections, some of the selected articles also had the potential to enhance readers’ knowledge of ways to diagnose and improve large-scale infrastructure needed to support the teaching of statistics. We characterize such knowledge by introducing the construct of statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT2). Whereas SKT can have a profound impact on student learning in a single classroom, SKT2 has an impact across multiple classrooms to improve the overall education system.","authors":["Randall E.

We draw on the social cognitive theory to theorize that customer courtesy can enhance service performance via its positive effect on employee self‐efficacy. Although getting customers to display courtesy may be outside an organization's direct control, we reason that management can amplify these benefits by establishing a strong organizational support climate. To examine our predictions, we developed a customer courtesy scale, then deployed it among service employees in the United States (Study 1) and hotel employees and their supervisors in East Asia (Study 2). We also collected experimental data (Study 3) to test our causal model. Across our studies, our data support the benefits of customer courtesy on employee self‐efficacy and, by extension, employee service performance. Moreover, our data reveal that when organizational support climate increases, the effect of customer courtesy on self‐efficacy and thus, service performance increases. Although it may be the case that bad is sometimes stronger than good, our work highlights the importance of positive workplace interactions (e.g., customer courtesy) on valued employee outcomes.","authors":["Eugene Kim","David J.

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a bioplastic whose precursor is an intermediate in the ethylmalonyl‐CoA pathway (EMCP), a pathway for acetyl‐CoA assimilation in bacteria. The genes that encode the enzymes for two different acetyl‐CoA assimilation pathways, the glyoxylate bypass (GB) and the EMCP, have been observed in two PHB‐producing bacteria:Rhodobacter capsulatusandParacoccus denitrificans. It was previously observed thatP. denitrificansasynchronously uses both pathways when grown with acetate. We producedR. capsulatusfusion strains by fusing the gene for a fluorescent protein, mCherry, to the gene of a key enzyme of the EMCP or GB and observed the fluorescence during growth with acetate. Tracking fluorescence allowed us to track the accumulation of each key enzyme, which indirectly indicates the activity of the pathway. We observed that unlikeP. denitrificans, the GB inR. capsulatusis not essential to growth with acetate.

The Clark lab has characterized two novel models of hyperglycemia in zebrafish in which DPN‐like phenotypes are recapitulated, including demyelination. In an attempt to elucidate the unknown molecular mechanisms of DPN, candidate small molecule drugs are currently being tested to accentuate or attenuate neurodegeneration. Lavendustin‐A, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was hypothesized to have a neuroprotective role, as overactivation of EGFR in hyperglycemic environments is associated with fibrosis and the inhibition of regeneration in various tissue types.Tg(mbp:gfpcaax)larval zebrafish were incubated in egg water (control 1) or 120mM glucose solution (control 2 and treatment) starting five days post‐fertilization (dpf) until 10dpf. From 10‐12dpf, control 1 remained in egg water + 1% DMSO, control 2 remained in glucose solution + 1% DMSO, and the treatment group remained in glucose solution + 1% DMSO + 65.5µM Lavendustin‐A. 12dpf, lateral images of myelinated (MBP+) peripheral motor nerves were taken on an EVOS imaging system. Fiji (NIH) software was used to measure the length and fluorescent intensity of the myelinated nerves. Both nerve length (*p=0.025) and MBP fluorescent intensity (**p=0.0013) were significantly greater in the treatment group compared to the hyperglycemic fish (control 2), and no significant difference was observed between the treatment group and control 1. To determine if function was impacted, a touch‐response assay was conducted before (10dpf) and after (12dpf) drug treatment. Escape response was significantly impaired in hyperglycemic fish (treatment and control 2) at 10dpf (***p=0.0007) and significantly improved in the treatment group by 12dpf (***p=0.0003), yet did not fully recover, as there was still a significant difference between the treatment group and control 1 (**p=0.0017). Our data suggests a possible role of EGFR in hyperglycemia‐induced neurodegeneration, getting us one step closer to identifying potential therapeutics for clinical application.","authors":["Madison MacDougall"],"journal":"The FASEB Journal","datePublished":"2022-5-13","aiKeywords":["Hyperglycemia","Neurodegeneration","Experimental Models in Research","Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy"],"facultyKeywords":["Neurobiology and neurosciences","Neurobiology and anatomy","Neuroscience","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Physiology, general","Health sciences, general","Public health","Public health, general","Medical clinical science","Health sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Health sciences, other","Oncology and cancer biology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.s1.r3213","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.s1.r3014","type":"paper","title":"Impaired vertebral development following hyperglycemic induction and recovery in Danio rerio","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic condition that can result in numerous comorbidities, including diabetes‐induced osteoporosis. Regardless of age, diabetics are at an increased risk of bone fracture as a result of decreased bone quality and mass. In the Clark lab we have previously established a glucose immersion model of hyperglycemic induction in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish are a viable model to study diabetic complications as they glucoregulate similar to mammals and have robust regenerative abilities previously shown to regenerate pancreatic b‐cells, peripheral nerves, cardiac muscle, and fins. Given the negative impact diabetes has on bones, we hypothesized that hyperglycemia would negatively impact vertebral development; but given zebrafish’s ability to regenerate we also hypothesized that after a recovery from hyperglycemia, the vertebrae would have a similar phenotype to controls. Larval zebrafish were incubated in 120 mM glucose solution (treatment), or egg water (control), for seven days beginning five days post fertilization (dpf). To assess vertebral development following a recovery period, zebrafish were placed in normal egg water for an additional ten days, and control fish were kept in egg water for an equal amount of time. Using alizarin red to visualize mineralized vertebrae after 7‐day incubation in glucose solution (12dpf) showed a reduced percentage of zebrafish with any mineralized vertebrae compared to controls (****p<0.0001). The vertebrae that were present following treatment had significantly less area of mineralized centra compared to controls (****p<0.0001). This suggests that hyperglycemia negatively impacted initial vertebral development. Following recovery (22 dpf), the treatment fish had significantly reduced total body length than controls (****p<0.0001). Treatment fish continued to have significantly less mineralized centra area (****p<0.0001) and significantly increased area of intervertebral domain (****p<0.0001) when compared to size matched controls. This suggests that the vertebrae of treatment fish are mineralizing and expanding into the intervertebral domain at a slower rate than controls. Additionally, glucose‐treated fish had significantly reduced percentage of fish with mineralized neural (****p<0.0001) and hemal (****p<0.0001) arches present on their vertebra compared to controls. These results suggest a dramatic impairment of vertebral development that extends beyond both treatment and recovery periods, leading us to believe the reduced mineralization may be responsible for the behavioral deficits through reductions in their ability to swim. Furthermore, our results may indicate profound effects of gestation and childhood diabetes on the skeletal development of children. Future experiments will investigate osteoblast and chondrocyte populations following hyperglycemic induction and recovery to elucidate the mechanisms that result in impaired vertebral mineralization. This discovery would guide further research into potential therapeutics for diabetes‐induced osteoporosis.","authors":["Sheridan Sargent"],"journal":"The FASEB Journal","datePublished":"2022-5-13","aiKeywords":["Regenerative abilities of zebrafish in the context of diabetes","Long-term effects of diabetes on bone health","Impact of hyperglycemia on vertebral development","Skeletal development and mineralization in zebrafish","Diabetes-induced osteoporosis"],"facultyKeywords":["Health sciences, general","Public health","Genetics and genomics","Biochemistry","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Health sciences, other","Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology","Human medical genetics","Microbiology and immunology nec","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology nec","Public health, general","Medical clinical science","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Molecular genetics","Molecular biology","Microbiology and immunology","Health services research","Biochemistry and molecular biology","Health sciences","Oncology and cancer biology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.s1.r3014","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1080/14608944.2022.2079118","type":"paper","title":"Exploring the relationship between national identity and attitudes towards immigrants in the United States","abstract":"As of 2018, there were more than 44.7 million immigrants residing, both lawfully and unlawfully, in the United States. Understanding the attitudes of U.S. citizens towards immigrants is necessary because of the impact that attitudes can have on policy development and the subsequent national treatment of immigrants based on those policies. This article utilizes a framework of national identity which suggests that this construct is comprised of three separate elements: nativism, emotionality, and behavior. Using U.S. citizen response data from three waves of the National Identity module of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) from 1995, 2003, and 2013, multivariate linear regressions were used to explore the relationship between this framework and attitudes towards immigrants. Findings indicated that there were statistically significant relationships between respondents’ perceptions of national identity and attitudes towards immigrants.

A major source of alternatives to capitalist organizations in the U.S. was the co-operative movement sponsored by the Knights of Labor during 1870–1889. This study examines cases of the Knights’ producer cooperatives to understand how they functioned and why they failed. The intent of the co-operatives was to restore worker independence and control over their work in the emerging factory system. This study applies core frames of social movements to examine the motivation and processes the Knights used to establish their cooperatives. Micro histories of selected co-ops in three regions of the U.S. were developed from primary research conducted during the 1880s as well as contemporary journals and newspapers. Rather than being radical, the co-operatives were based on American republican ideals, and they borrowed governance structures similar to corporations, both of which contributed to their success. Reasons for the failure of the Knights and their co-ops are examined. The legacy of the Knights’ producer co-ops is discussed along with ideas for future research.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: Co-operatives, Knights of Labor, labor republicanism, micro histories, social movement analysis.\\n\\nDisclosure statement\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\\n\\nCorrection Statement\\nThis article has been corrected with minor changes. These changes do not impact the academic content of the article.\\n\\nNotes\\n1. The nineteenth century hyphenated spelling of ‘co-operative’ is used throughout the paper.\\n2. Early non-labor co-operatives included communities of Robert Owen’s co-operative community in the 1820s and Charles Fourier’s Associationists in the 1840s; see, Wright (Citation2010).\\n3. The Knights backed Greenback Party sought monetary reform during a recession, but it faded with an upturn in the economy in 1879–82, see Curl (2012, pp. 89–90).\\n4. In the 1880s John Bates Clark, an economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore was interested in the growth of organizations using employee ownership and profit sharing. He divided up the country into five regions and assigned a doctoral student to study the development of these firms in each region. The five researchers (i.e. Edward Bemis, Albert Shaw, Amos Warner, Howard Shinn, and Daniel Randall) conducted onsite visits and interviews with many co-ops in their assigned regions. These studies formed the basis of their dissertations and were eventually published as the History of Co-operation in the United States (1888) which represented Vol. VI in the Johns Hopkins Studies in Historical and Political Science edited by Herbert B. Adams.\\n5. According to Curl (2012, pp. 88–91), by 1872 two-thirds of the employed were estimated to be wage earners.\\n6. For example, both the National Labor Union and the International Working People’s Association referred to or quoted the Declaration of Independence (Powderly, Citation1889, pp. 81–82).\\n7. The KoL’s first assemblies included sojourners, shipwrights, weavers, and riggers.\\n8. The great upheaval that resulted in over 100 strikers killed, over 500 wounded and more than 1000 jailed. Hayes use of troops to quell labor unrest was the first such presidential action in the U.S.\\n9. Powderly had been elected mayor of Scranton, PA, a mining and railroad center, under the Greenback Labor Party; once the party failed, Powderly became disillusioned with a political solution (Dubofsky & McCartin, 2017).\\n10. Prior to his KoL work, Sharpe had founded a co-operative community in Missouri and in 1884 became the editor of the Co-operative section of the Journal of United Labor.\\n11. Another poll taken at the General Assembly in 1884 revealed that only 14 members were in favor of a compulsory fee or tax to fund co-ops; thereafter it was left up to local assemblies.\\n12. In the face of bad harvests and depression, the French King was overthrown, and the Second Republic was established under Louis Napoleon III after a brief worker rebellion in Paris. It established the right to work among other things in France (see Agulhon, Citation1983).\\n13. Corporations had boards made up of both managers and outside members. The board hired the president who in turn hired other top managers who need not come from within the firm; it was not democratic like the co-ops. Furthermore, shares were sold to outsiders, and votes were based on shares held. Reports to shareholders were provided from one to four times a year. For more on corporate governance of the period see, see for example, Hilt (Citation2015).\\n14. Massachusetts co-op laws were amended in 1870 and 1879.\\n15. This proportional share of profits was modeled after the Rochdale distributive co-ops who distributed profits based on value of members’ purchases. This became a common practice in many KoL producer co-ops.\\n16. In 1869, forty-five artisan coopers were able to make all the oak and elm barrels needed by the flour mills. By the 1870s, the mills produced 10–20 long rail trains of product every 24 hours, hence, the growth in cooper co-ops.\\n17. The article went onto say that co-ops were most successful in New York, the West, and the South but not in New England.\\n18. During the final decade of the century, the Sherman Act was used to break at least a dozen unions, but not once to break a corporate trust.\\n19. The use of federally protected Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) developed as part of the Employment Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 made union buyouts feasible, see for example, ‘New York Times’ (Citation2003).\\n\\nAdditional information\\nNotes on contributors\\nRichard C.

However, the traits that make them highly adaptable may allow these fishes to successfully establish themselves outside of their native regions. In particular, the terrestrial capabilities of invasive amphibious fishes allow them to disperse overland, unlike fully aquatic invasive fishes, making their management more complicated. Despite numerous amphibious fish introductions around the world, ecological risk assessments and management plans often fail to adequately account for their terrestrial behaviors. In this review, I discuss the diversity of invasive amphibious fishes and what we currently know about why they emerge onto land, how they move around terrestrial environments, and how they orient while on land. In doing so, I use case studies of the performance and motivations of nonnative amphibious fishes in terrestrial environments to propose management solutions that factor in their complete natural history. Amphibious fish species have established a disproportionate number of nonative populations globally compared to fully aquatic species. Because of their terrestrial capabilities, we may need to manage amphibious fishes more like amphibians than fully aquatic fishes, but to do so, we need to learn more about how these species perform in a wide range of terrestrial environments and conditions.","authors":["Noah R Bressman"],"journal":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","datePublished":"2022-5-2","aiKeywords":["Ecological risk assessments","Adaptations of amphibious fishes","Need for revised management strategies","Invasive species management","Terrestrial capabilities of aquatic species","Dispersal and movement in terrestrial environments"],"facultyKeywords":["Marine sciences","Ecology","Ecology and evolutionary biology","Epidemiology and biostatistics","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Interdisciplinary computer sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences nec","Marine biology and biological oceanography","Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Geosciences, atmospheric, and ocean sciences","Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Microbiology and immunology nec","Ocean marine sciences and atmospheric science","Zoology and animal biology","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Geological and earth sciences nec","Biological and biomedical sciences","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Microbiology and immunology","Biological and biomedical sciences, other","Geology earth science, general","Geological and earth sciences","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icac023","licenseUrl":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model"},{"id":"10.1093/icb/icac037","type":"paper","title":"Effects of a Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonist on Sex Behavior in Females of the Southern Giant Pouched Rat","abstract":"In general, males should be particularly attentive to cues of sexual availability and females should advertize accordingly. Vaginal patency (i.e., the openness of the vagina) is a reliable indicator of sexual maturity; if the vagina is closed, the female is unable to copulate. The southern giant pouched rat (Cricetomys ansorgei) is unusual because females can have fully fused vaginal openings (i.e., vaginal nonpatency) despite being considered “adults” by other metrics. Moreover, some females reversibly close their vaginal openings. Thus, vaginal patency in the pouched rat is a “flexible” reproductive state. We subcutaneously implanted a long-acting GnRH agonist (deslorelin), which over time inhibits sex steroid secretion, to better understand the endocrinology and social behavior relating to vaginal patency in this species. We hypothesized that altering GnRH would impact both patency and behavior through its effects on circulating levels of estradiol. Six months of deslorelin treatment did not alter vaginal patency. Behaviorally, deslorelin-treated females spent less time interacting with, and were more aggressive towards males (compared to controls). Notably, deslorelin did not alter female scent marking. We conclude that behavioral receptivity, but not vaginal patency, is impacted by GnRH hormonal cascades in the pouched rat.","authors":["Aumena Choudhry","Amit Hanadari-Levy","Beverly Lo","Alexander G Ophir","Bhupinder Singh","Jacquelyn Berman","Angela R Freeman","Alexandra Chaves"],"journal":"Integrative And Comparative Biology","datePublished":"2022-5-19","aiKeywords":["Sexual signaling and receptivity in female southern giant pouched rats","Impact of GnRH treatment on social interactions","Vaginal patency as a measure of sexual maturity","Hormonal influence on reproductive behavior"],"facultyKeywords":["Biochemistry","Neurobiology and neurosciences","Neurobiology and anatomy","Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology","Biochemistry and molecular biology","Neuroscience","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology nec","Physiology, general","Health sciences, general","Medical clinical science","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Health sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Molecular biology","Health sciences, other"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icac037","licenseUrl":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model"},{"id":"10.1177/02692155241293247","type":"paper","title":"Standardizing blood flow restriction research—the crucial role of identifying apparatus in methodology and analysis: A letter to the editor","abstract":"Restricted access\\n\\nLetter\\n\\nFirst published online November 3, 2024\\n\\n**Standardizing blood flow restriction research—the crucial role of identifying apparatus in methodology and analysis: A letter to the editor**\\n\\nNicholas Rolnick [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0430-5015) nrolnick@gmail.com, Jim McEwen, […], Victor De Queiros, and Tim Werner [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4525-1308)\\n\\n**Keywords:** BFR training, autoregulation, commentary, arterial occlusion pressure, limb occlusion pressure\\n\\n**Authors:**\\n- Nicholas Rolnick, The Human Performance Mechanic, New York, NY, USA, CUNY Lehman College, Bronx, NY, USA, The BFR PROS, New York, NY, USA\\n- Jim McEwen, School of Biomedical Engineering and Departments of Orthopedics and Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada\\n- Victor De Queiros, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Natal-RN, Brazil\\n- Tim Werner, Department of Exercise Science, Salisbury University, Salisbury, MD, USA\\n\\n**Published In:** Clinical Rehabilitation\\n\\n**OnlineFirst**\\n\\n**DOI:** [10.1177/02692155241293247](https://doi.org/10.1177/02692155241293247)\\n\\n**References:**\\n1.

Some evidence suggests multimodal signals may not always improve receiver decision-making performance. When sensory systems process input from multimodal signal sources, multimodal noise may arise and potentially complicate decision-making due to the demands on cognitive integration tasks. We tested female túngara frog, Physalaemus (=Engystomops) pustulosus, responses to male mating signals in noise from multiple sensory modalities (acoustic and visual). Noise treatments were partitioned into three categories: acoustic, visual, and multimodal. We used natural calls from conspecifics and heterospecifics for acoustic noise. Robotic frogs were employed as either visual signal components (synchronous vocal sac inflation with call) or visual noise (asynchronous vocal sac inflation with call). Females expressed a preference for the typically more attractive call in the presence of unimodal noise. However, during multimodal signal and noise treatments (robofrogs employed with background noise), females failed to express a preference for the typically attractive call in the presence of conspecific chorus noise. We found that social context and temporal synchrony of multimodal signaling components are important for multimodal communication.

It’s not just that they rarely speak about the war; they typically have less dialogue overall than other characters, even as they appear in many scenes of the film and are often at the center of it. For Bartle, the protagonist of The Yellow Birds (Alexandre Moors, 2017), based on a novel of the same name by Kevin Powers (2012), silence is a survival tool during training; early on, for instance, he urges Murph, who will eventually become his best friend, to be quiet lest their sergeant hear them talking while they’re loading clips on the firing range. Silence for the post-war Bartle, however, is different, bound up not just with the combat he takes part in, but also with guilt, both for Murph’s death and for a war crime that the film gradually reveals. And while not every contemporary film about returning veterans has a war crime at its center—many such films, in fact, emphasize the veteran’s heroism—almost all cinematic combat veterans begin the film in silence.\\nThis silence is but the first step in a remarkably consistent generic arc: the cinematic veteran, returned to the United States, is characterized by silence; the narrative works toward a moment, either positioned as the climax or very nearly there, where the veteran tells their story; the story is told to a listener who often directly elicits the story; and once this story is told, the narrative implies a healing of wounds, with a promise of the veteran rejoining the community, often through the listener. (The consequences of not telling the story result in a different outcome, as we will see.) This arc is also one that we find in cinematic veterans on screen in earlier eras; Keith Beattie, whose work I discuss at greater length below, has traced out the Vietnam Veteran’s movement from silence to speech in narrative representation. But whereas for Beattie’s Vietnam Veteran, that transformation took years, the contemporary arc takes a mere two hours, and it occurs every time we view the films. And even if this was true for some earlier films as well, the consistency of the contemporary arc within a feature-film time-frame bears scrutiny here.\\nThis essay will trace out this arc, and explore each stage of it, within a single film: The Yellow Birds. By examining The Yellow Birds, my hope is that it might bring us a bit closer to understanding the stories we are telling ourselves about military veterans returning from contemporary U.S. wars. In doing so, I hope to begin shedding light on the ways we view those veterans, the ways we view those wars, and the truth and lies we tell ourselves about both.","authors":["David T Johnson"],"journal":"Film Criticism","datePublished":"2022-6-22","aiKeywords":["emotional implications of war and trauma","representation of combat veterans in cinema","societal perceptions of veterans and war","narrative arc from silence to storytelling","silence as a survival mechanism"],"facultyKeywords":["Social sciences","Linguistics","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies nec","Humanities, other","Performing arts","Ethnic studies","Visual arts, media studies, and design","English language and literature, general","Visual and performing arts","Film, cinema, and media studies","Sociology, general","English language and literature, letters","Humanities and humanistic studies","Rhetoric and composition, and writing studies","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Social sciences nec","Humanities","Theological and ministerial studies","Area studies","Musicology and ethnomusicology","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","Social sciences, other"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3998/fc.2712","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1098/rsbl.2022.0098","type":"paper","title":"Cross-modal facilitation of auditory discrimination in a frog","abstract":"Stimulation in one sensory modality can affect perception in a separate modality, resulting in diverse effects including illusions in humans. This can also result in cross-modal facilitation, a process where sensory performance in one modality is improved by stimulation in another modality. For instance, a simple sound can improve performance in a visual task in both humans and cats. However, the range of contexts and underlying mechanisms that evoke such facilitation effects remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated cross-modal stimulation in wild-caught túngara frogs, a species with well-studied acoustic preferences in females. We first identified that a combined visual and seismic cue (vocal sac movement and water ripple) was behaviourally relevant for females choosing between two courtship calls in a phonotaxis assay. We then found that this combined cross-modal stimulus rescued a species-typical acoustic preference in the presence of background noise that otherwise abolished the preference. These results highlight how cross-modal stimulation can prime attention in receivers to improve performance during decision-making. With this, we provide the foundation for future work uncovering the processes and conditions that promote cross-modal facilitation effects.","authors":["Logan S. James","Kimberly L.

Less is known about the within-group sociodemographic memberships among sexual minority people regarding access to health services. Using data from a nationally representative sample, a series of univariate and bivariate analyses were used to determine associations between sociodemographic group membership and access to health services. Results suggest there are significant differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population. Differences in access to health services when considering sex-at-birth, sexual identity, age, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, education level and income status were found. These findings offer insight into the role sociodemographic group membership has on the equity of access to health services. Specifically, results indicated that disproportionate access to health services among sexual minority people were more pronounced among those with group membership who experience social marginalisation. This was particularly true for sexual minority people who were bisexual, younger, Black and Latinx, lower-income earners and sexual minority people with less education attainment. Results from this study may be used to inform policies and practices aimed at improving access to health services including, but not limited to, the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and continued development of Federally Qualified Health Centers, while acknowledging the role of within-group differences among sexual minority people.\\n\\n## What is known about this topic\\n- Sexual minority people report less access to health services when compared to their heterosexual counterparts.\\n- Some differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population have been documented.\\n\\n## What this paper adds\\n- This paper reports differences in access to health services among sexual minority people living in the United States using a nationally representative sample.\\n- Findings suggest there are differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population when considering sex-at-birth, sexual identity, age, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, education level and income status.\\n\\n### Authors\\n- Daniel C.

Many had no prior online teaching experience and were given little time to adapt. This study examines pre-pandemic online teaching experience and training strategies used to learn how to teach online during the emergency remote teaching semester, perceptions of change in online teaching ability and the pandemic’s impact on teaching effectiveness, and interest in future online teaching opportunities. Method: Full-time faculty (<em>n</em> = 455) from four public regional universities in the southern United States completed a survey at the start of the Fall 2020 semester. Results: Over 35% had no prior online teaching experience, while 43% had taught several online courses. During the pandemic, in an effort to learn or improve online teaching skills, 13.4% sought peer mentoring, 31.9% completed a training program, and 34.9% both sought mentoring and completed training. Perceived online teaching skills, impact of the pandemic on teaching effectiveness, and interest in future online teaching were significantly related to prior online teaching experience and training sought. Conclusions: Faculty with less online experience perceived a greater negative effect of the pandemic on teaching performance and had less interest in future online teaching. Both mentoring and training enhanced perceived teaching skills, lowered the negative impact of the pandemic on teaching effectiveness, and promoted a positive attitude about future online teaching. Implications for Theory or Practice: The results provide support for the importance of faculty development programs in shaping attitudes and perceived effectiveness in online teaching and add to existent research on university faculty during the pandemic. Evidence from studies such as this provides universities with data that may be used to re-evaluate induction and training to improve instructional delivery in future instances when emergency remote teaching is required.","authors":["Kwonchan Jeon","Edward Hebert","Ralph Wood","Ismatara Reena"],"journal":"Higher Learning Research Communications","datePublished":"2022-6-22","aiKeywords":["Teaching effectiveness","Online teaching adaptation","Impact of COVID-19 on education","Faculty development and training","Future of online education"],"facultyKeywords":["Education research nec","Curriculum and instruction","Education research","Higher education evaluation and research","Teacher education","Education","Teacher education, specific levels and methods"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.18870/hlrc.v12i0.1322","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1519/jsc.0000000000004280","type":"paper","title":"Effect of an 11-Week Resistance Training Program on Arterial Stiffness in Young Women","abstract":"Morgan, B, Mirza, AM, Gimblet, CJ, Ortlip, AT, Ancalmo, J, Kalita, D, Pellinger, TK, Walter, JM, and Werner, TJ.

Twenty-four women, untrained college students, aged 18–22 years were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: control (CON) group (n= 8), high-intensity (HI) resistance exercise group (n= 8), and high-volume (HV) resistance exercise group (n= 8). Subjects randomized to resistance training groups were required to perform strength training exercises 3–5 days a week for 11 weeks. The exercise regimen consisted of 2–3 sets of 3–8 repetitions (80–90% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) for the HI group and 3–4 sets of 10–15 repetitions (50–70% of 1RM) for the HV group. All subjects were instructed to continue their normal diet and avoid cardiovascular exercise during the study. After the intervention, there was a significant increase in carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) (6.39 ± 0.73 to 8.40 ± 2.31 m·s−1;p< 0.05) and carotid radial PWV (9.77 ± 1.74 to 12.58 ± 2.09 m·s−1;p< 0.05) in the CON group alone.

Applying this to climate change may help us better understand the determinants of public opinion on that issue. Across four studies, we found that people who believe climate change is happening (the majority) underestimate the percentage of other people who hold their view, whereas those who do not believe climate change is happening (the minority) greatly overestimate agreement with their view. We consistently found this pattern for other contemporary issues where there was a clear majority/minority distinction. Furthermore, greater certainty of one's position on climate change was related to greater and more accurate estimates of agreement among the majority, whereas low certainty was associated with estimates closer to 50%. Consistent with cognitive availability as a mechanism for these findings, exploratory analyses suggest that greater certainty of climate change happening is associated with a greater subjective knowledge and frequency of thinking and hearing about climate change, and talking about it with others. Finding the majority/minority pattern of consensus bias for climate change and other issues suggests that general approaches, such as providing accurate normative data and targeting efforts according to a population's belief certainty, may impact public sentiment and engagement on climate change.","authors":["Amber R.

Channing Brown (Citation2018) writes of her lived experience as a Black woman navigating her existence within organizations that have no understanding that they operate from Whiteness, and the exhaustive emotional labor of trying to make visible the daily problematic actions that result. This (in)visibility means that her needs and racist experiences with the foundational Whiteness of the organizations, visible to her, are invisible to those she works with.\\n2. According to generative somatics practitioner Sumitra Rajkumar, somatics is a methodology that is fundamentally relational and political. It understands that unjust power dynamics inherent in our societies, cultures, and experiential perspectives shape us in deep, embodied ways (Werning Citation2018; McZeal Citation2021). Somatic social justice practices collective embodied healing for justly transforming society (Thom Citation2020).\\n3. White silence occurs “when people with white privilege stay complicitly silent when it comes to issues of race” (Saad Citation2020, 230). An impact of silencing is “a defending of the status quo of white supremacy” (Saad Citation2020, 54) and a betrayal of the work toward liberation. Silencing can operate on an individual level, such as a dance professor not addressing racial harm in the studio or racism as a structural oppression in dance in their syllabus. It can also operate in group dynamics or systems, such as a dance department’s enacted policies or certification programming curriculum.\\n4.

Unfortunately, the potential for misconduct has been exacerbated in recent years by rapid advances in technology, easy access to information, competitive pressures, and the proliferation of websites that provide students access to information that allows them to directly circumvent the learning process. Using a convenience sample of 631 students matriculating in various business majors at four U.S. universities and structural equations modeling procedures, this study assesses the effects of psychological factors on business students’ propensities to utilize the services of homework assistance websites. Specifically, we examine how “Dark Triad” personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) interact with Fraud Diamond elements to influence student decisions to engage the services of these websites.

It appears that both species primarily use a benthic-oriented ambush foraging strategy under high turbidity conditions. This is a particularly pronounced switch in foraging style forP. lethostigma. Estuarine turbidity is increasing due to the impacts of climate change. When turbidity is elevated enough to eliminate light sufficient for visual feeding on mysids (between darkness and the lowest light level tested), feeding on this motile prey is negatively impacted for both species.

Participants (n = 57) were recruited from a historically black college and university (HBCU), cross-matched by sex, age (±1 year), 1-RM (±2.27 kg), 1-RM/weight (±0.1), and 1-RM/lean mass ratio (±0.1), and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (vision occluded) or the control group. Participants performed resistance training for 6 weeks prior to beginning the study, and 1-RM was assessed the week prior to the beginning of the study. Weight and body composition were measured using a BOD POD. Of the 57 participants who started the study, 34 completed the study (Experimental = 16, Control = 18) and were reassessed the week after completing the 6-week-long training protocol. Using a combination of Mann–Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, we found that when accounting for changes in lean muscle mass, individuals who trained with their vision occluded reported significantly greater improvements in 1-RM strength compared to those who did not (p < 0.05). The findings from our study suggest that vision-occluded progressive resistance training increases upper-extremity performance when assessed using the bench press. These findings may have significant practical implications in both sports and rehabilitation, as these techniques may be used to enhance performance in athletes and/or improve rehabilitation effectiveness.","authors":["Ali Boolani","Daniel Fuller","Masoud Moghaddam","Shantanu Sur","Rebecca Martin","Rumit Singh Kakar","Mostafa Ali Elwan","Sumona Mondal","Ahmed Ali Torad","Ahmed Kadry"],"journal":"Vision","datePublished":"2022-8-2","aiKeywords":["upper-extremity performance","sports application","progressive resistance training","vision-occluded training","strength improvement","rehabilitation effectiveness"],"facultyKeywords":["Exercise physiology and kinesiology","Biomedical sciences, general","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Health sciences","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences, other","Exercise science and kinesiology","Biological and biomedical sciences","Health sciences, other"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vision6030047","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1249/01.mss.0000883536.82798.8b","type":"paper","title":"The Effects Of Home-based Functional Bodyweight Training On Neuromuscular Function","abstract":"G-18 Late-Breaking Abstracts The Effects Of Home-based Functional Bodyweight Training On Neuromuscular Function\\n2317 Moghaddam, Masoud1; Cervantes, Mason1; Estrada, Carlos A.2; Muddle, Tyler W.D.3; Jacobson, Bert H.

Indeed, due to the global pandemic, physical activity has been reduced by 32.3% among previously active participants. Regular exercise is an effective way to maintain health and also results in various physiological adaptations in the neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems, which lead to improved physical performance.\\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a functional training program, delivered via Zoom, on the neuromuscular system as well as resting blood pressure measures.\\nMETHODS: Fifteen participants were assigned to either exercise (M = 4; F = 5) or control (M = 3; F = 3) group. The 4-week bodyweight circuit exercise protocol (i.e., jumping jacks; modified push-ups; high knees; squat; mountain climbers; and lunges) was performed 3d/wk for four weeks. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) were performed using a handgrip dynamometer. During each contraction, surface electromyography (sEMG) and force signals were recorded to assess sEMG amplitude (RMS) of flexor carpi radialis muscle as well as peak force (PF). Additionally, the brachial artery's resting blood pressure (BP) in a fasted state was recorded before and after the 4-week intervention. BP was self-monitored by participants once a day for 4 weeks to evaluate systolic and diastolic pressure readings. Two-way ANOVAs with factors of group [i.e., home-based exercise (HBE); control (CON)] and time [i.e., pre-post] were used to analyze pre- and post-testing measures.\\nRESULTS: No significant (p > 0.05) differences between groups were observed in resting BP and sEMG-RMS. However, the HBE group significantly (p < 0.05) increased MVIC of the right hand (HBE: 27.8 ± 5.1 to 31.2 ± 5.2 kg, CON: 26.0 ± 2.3 to 25.6 ± 2.6 kg) from pre- to post-testing.\\nCONCLUSION: Despite the lack of significant improvements in neural activation and resting blood pressure, the HBE groups significantly improved muscular strength by performing home-based functional circuit workouts. These findings suggest that home-based functional training delivered remotely is an effective strategy to improve muscular strength after four weeks.

Focusing on medical equipment manufacturers, this study empirically examines how supply chain management impacts manufacturers’ responses to epidemic-driven demand. This study employs novel supply chain data from South Korea collected before and after the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic event. In the results, we show that such an epidemic positively influences the sales performance of medical equipment manufacturers (i.e. a 10.2 percentage-point increase). To identify the mechanism behind this result, we provide evidence that increasing the supply base (i.e. the number of supply channels) enables medical equipment manufacturers to better respond to epidemic-driven demand and ultimately improves their sales performance. More interestingly, we find that medical equipment manufacturers with lower market status (i.e. lower market shares and lower supplier shares) expand their supply bases more extensively than other medical equipment manufacturers with higher market status do. Interpreting these results, we offer managerial insights into how medical equipment manufacturers can effectively manage their supply chains and improve their performance when responding to epidemic-driven demand.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: Supply base, supply channel, epidemic and pandemic, epidemic-driven demand, empirical study\\n\\nData availability statement\\nThe data supporting the findings of this study are available from eCredible.

YPAR has been traditionally conducted in person, with virtual forums typically serving as ways to share resources and ideas across independent YPAR teams or collecting data. The COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the closure of most public spaces where youth congregate (including schools) and requirements to socially distance, led to translating YPAR projects into completely virtual formats. This paper aims to provide promises and challenges of conducting virtual YPAR during the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes how a team of university faculty, college students, and youth from two community-based youth organizations navigated a YPAR experience during the 2020-2021 academic year. We provide reflections on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on (a) the research setting, (b) the building of collaborative relationships, (c) YPAR methodology, (d) youth engagement, and (e) conceptualization of community action and engagement.

Did the experience of exile and immigration preserve or even heighten a national identity among radicals who openly espoused revolutionary internationalism? Anarchists distinguished between nation and nationality on the one hand, and the state and nationalism on the other. This article examines expressions of nationality by a handful of German anarchist editors and writers from the 1880s to the end of World War II. They wanted to be stateless, but not nationless. This article argues that German exile anarchists in the United States and Brazil expressed a militant, countercultural, antistatist and anticlerical nationality. They were ‘rooted cosmopolitans’: They identified with the international revolutionary tradition and at the same time remained attached to Germany's heritage of radical politics, arts and humanities. There was a remarkable consistency in their commentary levelled against Bismarck, the Kaiser, the Weimar government and the Nazis either in Germany or in the host country. Anarchists advocated for a borderless global federation of free communities and, to that end, rejected nationalism and urged people to stop ‘seeing like a state’ by exposing the false promises and crimes of statism.","authors":["Tom Goyens"],"journal":"Nations and Nationalism","datePublished":"2022-10-28","aiKeywords":["Militant counterculture","Anarchism","Internationalism","Critique of statism","National identity","Cultural heritage","Exile and immigration"],"facultyKeywords":["Religion religious studies","History","Social sciences","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Humanities, other","Ethnic studies","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","Philosophy and religious studies nec","Philosophy","Bible biblical studies","Philosophy and religious studies","Sociology, general","Humanities and humanistic studies","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Humanities","Theological and ministerial studies","Area studies","American history (United States)","European history"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nana.12894","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1080/17448727.2022.2156193","type":"paper","title":"The intersections of postcolonialism, postsecularism, and literary studies: Potentials, limitations, bibliographies","abstract":"This article presents some features, potentials, limitations, and bibliographies of the intersection of postcolonialism, postsecularism, and literary studies.

Alpha diversity in the parent material was initially low and increased to reference levels within 3 years of marsh construction, while in the newly accumulating organic matter-rich surface soils alpha diversity was initially high and remained unchanged. Microbial community succession was fastest in the surface horizon (~ 24 years to reference equivalency) and became progressively slower with depth in the subsurface horizons (~ 30–67 years). Random forest linear regression analysis was used to identify important taxa driving the trajectories toward reference conditions. In the parent material, putative sulfate-reducers (Desulfobacterota), methanogens (Crenarchaeota, especiallyMethanosaeta), and fermenters (ChloroflexiandClostridia) increased over time, suggesting an enrichment of these metabolisms over time, similar to natural marshes. Concurrently in the surface soils, the relative abundances of putative methane-, methyl-, and sulfide oxidizers, especially amongGammaproteobacteria, increased over time, suggesting the co-development of sulfide and methane removal metabolisms in the marsh soils. Finally, we observed that the surface soil communities at one of the marshes did not follow the trajectory of the others, exhibiting a greater relative abundance of anaerobic taxa. Uniquely in this dataset, this marsh was developing signs of excessive inundation stress in terms of vegetation coverage and soil geochemistry. Therefore, we suggest that soil microbial community structures may be effective bioindicators of salt marsh inundation and are worthy of further targeted investigation.","authors":["Lorie W.

Several famous VIs have endorsed fashion brands, appearing in the advertising campaigns (e.g., Lil Miquela x Prada). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of using VIs as fashion brand endorsers. Specifically, we tested the impacts of the five perceived characteristics of VIs (attractiveness, innovativeness, curiosity, authenticity, and controllability) on consumer’s attitudes to the advertisement featuring VIs, brand attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward the brand. Data were collected from 252 consumers aged in 18-25 through Amazon MTurk. Structural equation modeling results indicated that the more consumers perceived VIs as attractive, authentic, controllable, and curious, the more positively they reacted to the advertisement featuring VIs as well as to the brand (and vice versa). Brand attitudes influenced behavioral intentions toward the brand. Consumer’s innovativeness and market mavenism were significant moderating variables.\\nKeywords: Virtual influencers, virtual humanoids, influencer marketing\\n\\nHow to Cite:\\nLee, J. & Park, K., (2022) “I Am a Digital Human”: Effectiveness of Using Virtual Influencers as Fashion Brand Endorsers”, International Textile and Apparel Association Annual Conference Proceedings 79(1).\\n\\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.31274/itaa.15991\\n\\nPublished on 2022-12-31\\nPeer Reviewed\\nLicense: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0","authors":["Ji Young Lee","Ki Ho Park"],"journal":"Innovate to Elevate","datePublished":"2022-12-31","aiKeywords":["Consumer attitudes towards advertisements","Influencer marketing strategies","Effectiveness of virtual influencers in marketing","Perceived characteristics of digital endorsers","Brand attitudes and behavioral intentions"],"facultyKeywords":["Social sciences nec","Business administration and management nec","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Sociology, general","Social sciences","Business","Organizational behavior studies","Business, other","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Business administration and management","Marketing","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","Social sciences, other","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies nec"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.31274/itaa.15991","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0"},{"id":"10.1080/14783363.2022.2158077","type":"paper","title":"R&D investment, intellectual capital, organizational learning, and firm performance: a study of Chinese software companies","abstract":"The effect of R&D investment on firm performances is subject of a number of internal factors.

In this essay, it is argued that statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT) should be considered an important component of their preparation as well. Health care professionals often must help others understand the statistical basis for recommendations they make. A COVID-19 press briefing is used to illustrate the need for SKT when making high-stakes recommendations related to public health. It is conjectured that efforts to educate the public during the press briefing would have been enhanced if the presenters had deeper knowledge of the general public’s common statistical thinking patterns, the typical statistics curriculum experienced by members of their audience, and contemporary tools for teaching statistics. The importance of such knowledge to support smaller-scale individual interactions is also discussed. A call for SKT-centered partnerships between educational researchers and medical researchers is made; such partnerships could be mutually beneficial to the development of both fields and to society at large.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Dynamic statistics software, Medical research, Pedagogical content knowledge, Statistical knowledge for teaching, Statistical thinking\\n\\n## 1  Introduction\\nIt is widely accepted that statistics is an important part of the knowledge base for those in the health professions (e.g., World Federation for Medical Education Citation2015; Oster and Enders Citation2018). Statistical knowledge allows health care professionals to understand research literature and conduct their own studies. Although the specific statistical concepts to be addressed and appropriate pedagogical approaches are at times under-specified in standards for medical education (Hayat Citation2014), few would argue against requiring those entering the health professions to study statistics. This essay focuses on a different type of knowledge that health care professionals should have: statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). SKT is not equivalent to statistical knowledge. Concisely stated, SKT is knowledge that allows one to make statistics comprehensible to others (Groth Citation2013). Health care professionals need to help people make evidence-based decisions about courses of action for preserving and improving their well-being (Nelson et al. Citation2002), though their ability and confidence to do so are sometimes questionable (Rao Citation2008). Doctors and nurses frequently make data-based recommendations during private interactions with individuals; government officials charged with preserving public health are sometimes called upon to do so on a large scale in public. This educational responsibility was especially visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. This essay argues that having statistical knowledge alone is not sufficient to teach the public about the evidential basis for recommended health practices. It is also important to have knowledge of effective teaching practices that account for how people generally interpret statistics.\\n\\nThe essay begins with a brief description of the nature of SKT and how it overlaps, yet differs from, statistical and mathematical knowledge. Then, the notion of SKT is used to reflect upon a widely viewed press briefing in which two prominent health care professionals in the United States tried to explain the statistical basis for COVID-19 mitigation measures and treatments at a critical point in the pandemic timeline. The major statistical concepts they dealt with during the press briefing are discussed, and conjectures about how their attempt to educate the public may have been enhanced by deeper SKT are made. Broader implications about the need for SKT among health care professionals around the world and strategies for meeting the need are then considered.\\n\\n## 2  The Nature of SKT\\nSKT encompasses more than just statistics subject matter knowledge; it also includes pedagogical content knowledge (Groth Citation2013). Shulman (Citation1987) characterized pedagogical content knowledge as the “special amalgam of content and pedagogy that is uniquely the province of teachers, their own special form of professional understanding” (p. 8). Having subject matter expertise alone does not make one an effective teacher; good statisticians may or may not have pedagogical skill. Pedagogical content knowledge has been studied extensively within the context of teachers in conventional classroom settings (Depaepe, Verschaffel, and Kelchtermans Citation2013); the present article extends the consideration of pedagogical content knowledge to health care professionals charged with making evidence-based recommendations to the public.\\n\\nHill, Ball, and Schilling (Citation2008) discussed three essential components of pedagogical content knowledge: knowledge of content and students, knowledge of content and teaching, and curriculum knowledge. These three components have been used widely in research on SKT (Langrall et al. Citation2017). Knowledge of content and students involves knowing how individuals commonly understand, and misunderstand, statistics content. Such knowledge supports knowledge of content and teaching, which allows for the selection of pedagogical strategies that leverage existing student understandings and address their common misunderstandings. A third component of pedagogical content knowledge, curriculum knowledge, provides understanding of the broad frameworks and learning progressions that generally undergird the teaching of statistics.\\n\\nAlong with being more than just statistical subject matter knowledge, SKT is also more than just mathematical knowledge. Undoubtedly, a great deal of mathematical knowledge is needed to teach statistics. However, considerable amounts of nonmathematical knowledge are needed as well. For example, those who teach statistics must know how to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic questions, construct surveys, design studies, and interpret results in context (Groth Citation2007). Mathematical knowledge is necessary, but not sufficient, for such tasks. Many statistical tasks are highly context-dependent and not reducible to deterministic algorithms and conclusions. At its core, statistics is the study of variation and uncertainty. This stands in contrast to mathematics, in which deductive reasoning can lead to definitive proofs. Mathematical tools are helpful for statistical tasks, yet we cannot expect them to produce conclusions as certain as those of mathematical proofs in most statistical contexts. Reconciling certainty in mathematics with uncertainty in statistics is a nontrivial task. Knowing how to help the public distinguish between statistical and mathematical conclusions during a time of anxiety such as the COVID-19 pandemic is especially challenging, as people naturally seek unequivocal answers to questions that cannot be answered with complete certainty.\\n\\n## 3  SKT in the Context of a COVID-19 Press Briefing\\nIn the United States, at the outset of the pandemic, Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci were charged with explaining the basis for government-led COVID-19 mitigation and efforts to develop treatments and vaccines. On March 31, 2020, the two doctors employed statistical tools and arguments during a press briefing to do so. The press briefing came at a critical time, as the United States had recorded just a small percentage of its eventual deaths from the virus (approximately 4000 of what would grow to be over 250,000), and audiences for the daily briefings from the White House were averaging approximately 8 million viewers (Grynbaum Citation2020). A primary goal of the briefing was to argue in favor of extending existing mitigation measures, which included stay-at-home orders, business closures, and maintaining social distance in public. Video of the press briefing was posted online afterward (e.g., https://www.c-span.org/video/?470841-1/white-house-warns-upcoming-painful-weeks&live=). Quotes in this essay were drawn from the government video transcript (available from https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-15/). The statistical subject matter of the press briefing included models, disaggregation of data, and experimental study design. Next, a summary of how Drs. Birx and Fauci dealt with each of these statistical ideas during the press briefing is given, followed by conjectures about how deeper SKT related to the three main statistical ideas may have enhanced their efforts to teach the public.\\n\\n### 3.1  Press Briefing Introductory Presentation Summary\\nDr. Birx began her portion of the press briefing by projecting the slide shown in Figure 1. Two curves appeared on the slide: one to illustrate the spread of COVID-19 without mitigation measures, and another to illustrate its spread with mitigation measures fully in place. She explained that the curves were based on modeling done by “five or six international and domestic modelers from Harvard, from Columbia, from Northeastern, from Imperial who helped us tremendously.” In reference to the curve on the far left in Figure 1, Dr. Birx stated, “In their estimates, they had between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people in the United States succumbing to this virus without mitigation.” She explained that the curve on the far right showed projected deaths if mitigation measures such as social distancing and hand-washing were fully implemented, saying, “what an extraordinary thing this could be if every American followed these, and it takes us to that stippled mountain that’s much lower—a hill, actually—down to 100,000 to 200,000 deaths, which is still way too much.”\\n\\n...

This study examines the origins of the canning industry via the experiences of three of its earliest entrepreneurs: Edward Wright, William Numsen, and Thomas Kensett II. The narrative examines key aspects of the industry’s context including the growth in demand for preserved foods, the resources of the Chesapeake region, and the development of food preservation technology. Using the five characteristics of entrepreneurial processes, the importance of entrepreneurs in the development of the economic growth of Baltimore’s early canning industry is examined. Each founder exhibited entrepreneurial characteristics in different ways. One failed in his efforts; the other two succeeded in developing businesses that endured into the next century. The study reveals that using entrepreneurial processes does not guarantee success, and that there are various paths to success. An entrepreneurial multiplier effect was also evident in the growth of firms producing supplies and equipment for canners. Using an entrepreneurial lens offers a closer insight into the development of firms and their industries. Some remaining unanswered questions as well as avenues for future studies are discussed.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: Canning industry, entrepreneurial processes, industry growth, Chesapeake region, Baltimore city, food preservation\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\nI would like to thank Dr. Céline Carayon for encouraging me to pursue this project and for her helpful comments on early drafts.

E. I. DuPont was French (Chandler Citation 1962), Andrew Carnegie of US Steel was Scottish (Hughes Citation 1973), and George Brown, a co-founder of the B&O was for Northern Ireland (Baltimore 1871).\\n2. Ships from U.S. ports included: Boston, New York, Charleston, and New Orleans while those from foreign ports were from London, Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam, and Barbados.\\n3. Typical stages of the life cycle include: start up, growth, maturity, and decline. Each industry varies in time for each stage. Moreover, life cycles can be extended or shortened by new technologies.\\n4. Appert won a grant from the French government to develop his food preservation method (Frank 1953).\\n5. According to May (Citation 1937), the solder used was made of lead and copper; lead exposure was an additional but unknown health risk at the time.\\n6. Isaac Solomon of Baltimore is credited with use of calcium chloride to raise water temperature. Andrew K. Shriver, of Baltimore, was granted the patent for the steam retort cooker.\\n7. Suppliers included label printers and can manufacturers who produced 20–30 million cans annually in Baltimore by the 1880s, see Howard (1873, 102).\\n8. While early research focused on entrepreneurial traits of individuals that has not proven to be as fruitful as examining traits of entrepreneurial firms because starting a successful firm(s) is the mark of a successful entrepreneur, see for example, Markham (Citation 2007).\\n9. After an economic setback, Numsen’s parents had left for U.S. a few years earlier leaving William and his sister with grandparents until they could pay for their voyage (Baltimore Sun, 17 December 1891).\\n10. In 1850 Thomas left the firm and John Carroll joined so the firm was renamed to Numsen, Carroll & Co. After he left the firm, it became Numsen & Sons.\\n11. Among the boards Numsen sat on included: Alex, Brown & Sons, Central Savings Bank, the Carrollton and Fountain hotels (Baltimore Sun, 17 December 1891).\\n12. Included among the boards Kensett served on were: Federal Hill Steam Ferry Company, the Board of Trade, First National Bank, the Second National and Mechanics Banks (Baltimore Sun, January 30, 9 June 1854, 5 October 1865, 29 March 1869, 1870; Mayer Citation 1871).\\n13. In today’s currency Kensett’s estate would be worth $50 million according to: Ian Webster, ‘$1,000,000 in 1880 to 2018 Inflation Calculator,’ U.S. Official Inflation Data, Alioth Finance, 18 November Citation 2019.\\n14. Kensett’s father had also been an engraver which may have alerted his son to the power of graphics for labels (Howard Citation 1873).\\n15. Predecessor to today’s Maryland State Fair.\\n16.

The paper finds robust evidence that unfavorable trade regulations significantly reduce export entry rate and export entry density (two critical measures of export entrepreneurship) by increasing the time and cost associated with documentary and customs compliance procedures. These findings support the hypothesis that less conducive business regulations are an important domestic supply constraint which impedes export entrepreneurship by increasing trade costs. In addition, the paper finds that the magnitude of the negative relationship between export entrepreneurship and regulation‐driven trade barriers is significantly more pronounced in countries with poor governance quality. Two measures of governance quality (i.e., political stability and rule of law) are shown to be relatively more significant in aiding favorable trade regulations that promote export entrepreneurship. Furthermore, a reduction in regulation‐driven trade barriers has a positive impact on net entry rate and survival rates of first‐, second‐ and third‐year exporters, and high‐quality governance institutions significantly increase the magnitude of this positive relationship.","authors":["Jonathan Munemo"],"journal":"Regulation &amp; Governance","datePublished":"2021-1-21","aiKeywords":["Regulatory impact","Trade costs","Trade barriers","Export entrepreneurship","Governance quality"],"facultyKeywords":["Economics","Environmental natural resource economics","Business administration and management nec","Business management and administration","Social sciences","Business","Political science and government","Economics, general","Public policy analysis, general","Political science and government, general","Business administration and management","Public policy analysis","Development economics and international development"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rego.12384","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1080/19338341.2021.1875256","type":"paper","title":"Integration of Creative Thinking and Critical Thinking to Improve Geosciences Education","abstract":"Dr. X.

Trump’s “presidential” rhetoric as a clear and present danger","abstract":"For the past 100 years, the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, from 1919 has stood as a landmark case due to the Court’s creation of a “Clear and Present Danger” standard of freedom of speech. Through the vehicle of the Clear and Present Danger measure, the Court reconsidered that the degree of freedom for inflammatory rhetoric could be legally permissible until the point that realistic danger of harm or illegal action might occur. One century after this ruling, this paper examines the unprecedentedly divisive and uncivil public rhetoric of a US President, Donald J. Trump. Through a descriptive analysis summarizing the characteristics of President Trump’s rhetoric, we contend that Trump generates a level of dangerous Presidential communication not publicly expressed by previous Presidents that arguably could be considered to overstep the limits of free expression set forth by the courts.

This child’s dread-charged awe before the Stranger brings into focus the tension fundamental to our lives—our being torn between openness to the unprecedented future and the desire to protect ourselves from it. Dialoguing with Loewald, Freud, and Heidegger, I consider the radical anxiety the child experiences when exposed to the dreadful not—the absence of the needed. Dialoguing with Aristotle, I discuss how wonder draws the child into harmonious play with alterities that are intelligible to her. However, from the beginning the child is surrounded by alterities whose transcendence overwhelms her. We recoil from such transcendence because it fills us with dread, are drawn to it because it fills us with awe.

Given the mixture of the advantages and risks deciding whether to use them is not an easy matter, casting a doubt about sustainable growth and development of smart speakers. Using a sample of 559 users in South Korea and the U.S., we empirically investigated the dilemma of users seeking to adopt smart speakers. The results revealed users’ perceived usefulness and enjoyment positively influenced the intention to adopt smart speakers. No direct effect of perceived ease of use was found but this effect was completely mediated by perceived usefulness and enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment was found to be twice as strong as perceived usefulness in determining the usage intention, confirming the hedonic aspect of smart speakers. Conversely, perceived privacy risks were shown to be a significant negative factor. This negative impact was significantly stronger in the U.S. than in South Korea. We could infer that the more mature the stage of acceptance of smart speakers, the greater the sensitivity of users to privacy risks. Lastly, in the South Korean sample, we found that the perceived usefulness could reduce the negative impact of perceived risks on the intention. to adopt smart speakers.","authors":["Chanhi Park","Jong Hyun Wi","Hoon S.

This study explored grit at the organizational level by interviewing leaders’ perceptions of what may be a culture of organizational grit. Participants included 14 U.S. military officers. Seven themes emerged relative to the research question: “What do U.S. military officers perceive as a culture of organizational grit?” Themes included professional pride, team unity, resilience-determination, mission accomplishment, core values, growth mindset, and deliberate practice. This study indicated that a culture of organizational grit is likely a combination of converging organizational elements. Overall, findings indicate that there may be a culture of organizational grit in the military and at the least, more research examining the concept is warranted.","authors":["Prince A.

To identify genes that support enzalutamide resistance, we performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in the bone-homing, castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line, C4-2B. We identified 11 genes (TFAP2C, CAD, SPDEF, EIF6, GABRG2, CDC37, PSMD12, COL5A2, AR, MAP3K11, and ACAT1) whose loss resulted in decreased cell survival in response to enzalutamide. To validate our screen, we performed transient knockdowns in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells and evaluated cell survival in response to enzalutamide. Through these studies, we validated three genes (ACAT1, MAP3K11, and PSMD12) as supporters of enzalutamide resistance in vitro. Although ACAT1 expression is lower in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer samples versus primary prostate cancer samples, knockdown of ACAT1 was sufficient to reduce cell survival in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells. MAP3K11 expression increases with Gleason grade, and the highest expression is observed in metastatic castration-resistant disease. Knockdown of MAP3K11 reduced cell survival, and pharmacologic inhibition of MAP3K11 with CEP-1347 in combination with enzalutamide resulted in a dramatic increase in cell death. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of AR-Serine650, which is required for maximal AR activation. Finally, although PSMD12 expression did not change during disease progression, knockdown of PSMD12 resulted in decreased AR and AR splice variant expression, likely contributing to the C4-2B and 22Rv1 decrease in cell survival. Our study has therefore identified at least three new supporters of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro.","authors":["Robert J. Matusik","Robert A.

The current study contributes to the literature by examining body-esteem based on type of sexual victimization experience (i.e., none, sexual contact, attempted sexual coercion, sexual coercion, attempted rape, rape). Participants included undergraduate women ( n = 750) who completed the Body-Esteem Scale ( Franzoi & Shields, 1984 ) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization ( Koss et al., 2007 ), and had either no history of sexual victimization experience or experience within the past year. Women with no sexual victimization experience did not differ from women with sexual contact experience, but both groups reported higher body-esteem than women with coercion, attempted coercion, and rape experience. These three latter groups did not differ from one another, but each reported lower body-esteem than women with attempted rape experience, who reported higher body-esteem than those with no experience. Findings are preliminary but suggest that body-esteem may be negatively associated with some types of sexual victimization experience (attempted and completed coercion, rape), but not others (sexual contact, attempted rape), and escaping rape may increase positive feelings toward one’s body.","authors":["Jamie P.

We investigated the influence of food availability, predation risk, and the perceived predation risk on habitat use by a primate living under high hunting pressure, the yellow‐breasted capuchin monkeys,Sapajus xanthosternos, at Una Biological Reserve (ReBio Una). We hypothesized that the hunting pressure occurring in the capuchins' home range would favor predator avoidance to the detriment of searching for food. We characterized a set of covariates related to resource availability (fruit and invertebrate biomasses, feeding on dispersed and clumped food items, sleeping sites), perceived predation risk (alarm calls given to terrestrial and aerial predators, silent group movement, and vigilance behavior), and actual predation risk (evidence of hunting) and estimated their effects on how one group of capuchin monkeys uses its habitat. The group divides its time among three major forest types within their home range: agroforest, mature, and secondary. Our results suggest that the actual and perceived risk of hunting by humans, as well as the perceived predation risk by both terrestrial and aerial predators, were significant determinants of capuchin monkeys' space use. Yellow‐breasted capuchin monkeys' space use was negatively related to the risk of hunting by humans (actual evidence and silent behavior), the perceived risk of predation by both aerial and terrestrial predators, and the presence of sleeping sites. Capuchin monkeys' use of space was not related to the biomass of fruits in the habitat, and the biomass of invertebrates had a very low positive effect. We confirmed our prediction that in a habitat with high hunting pressure, the risk of predation, both perceived and actual, had a more significant impact on how yellow‐breasted capuchins used space than did food availability.","authors":["Andrea Presotto","Priscila Suscke","Patrícia Izar"],"journal":"American Journal of Primatology","datePublished":"2021-3-23","aiKeywords":["Habitat use and spatial behavior","Impact of hunting pressure on wildlife","Trade-offs between food searching and predator avoidance","Effects of predation risk on animal behavior","Resource availability and its influence on animal ecology"],"facultyKeywords":["Ethnic studies","Ecology and evolutionary biology","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","Sociology, general","Social sciences","Evolutionary biology","Developmental biology and embryology","Cell cellular and molecular biology","Area studies","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Cell cellular biology and anatomy","Ecology","Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Biological and biomedical sciences","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Cell cellular biology and anatomy nec"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajp.23243","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1093/plankt/fbab014","type":"paper","title":"Phytoplankton carbon and nitrogen biomass estimates are robust to volume measurement method and growth environment","abstract":"Phytoplankton biomass is routinely estimated using relationships between cell volume and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content that have been defined using diverse plankton that span orders of magnitude in size. Notably, volume has traditionally been estimated with geometric approximations of cell shape using cell dimensions from planar two-dimensional (2D) images, which requires assumptions about the third, depth dimension. Given advances in image processing, we examined how cell volumes determined from three-dimensional (3D), confocal images affected established relationships between phytoplankton cell volume and C and N content. Additionally, we determined that growth conditions could result in 30–40% variation in cellular N and C. 3D phytoplankton cell volume measurements were on average 15% greater than the geometric approximations from 2D images. Volume method variation was minimal compared to both intraspecific variation in volumes (~30%) and the 50-fold variation in elemental density among species. Consequently, C:vol and N:vol relationships were unaltered by volume measurement method and growth environment. Recent advances in instrumentation, including those for at sea and autonomous applications can be used to estimate plankton biomass directly. Going forward, we recommend instrumentation that permits species identification alongside size and shape characteristics for plankton biomass estimates.","authors":["Susanne Menden-Deuer","Courtney Nicole Hammond","Heather Mcnair"],"journal":"Journal of Plankton Research","datePublished":"2021-3-15","aiKeywords":["Three-dimensional imaging techniques","Impact of growth conditions on phytoplankton","Carbon and nitrogen content relationships","Cell volume measurement","Phytoplankton biomass estimation"],"facultyKeywords":["Ecology and evolutionary biology","Ocean marine sciences and atmospheric science","Oceanography, chemical and physical","Biochemistry","Molecular biology","Marine sciences","Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology","Marine biology and biological oceanography","Ecology","Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Biological and biomedical sciences","Geosciences, atmospheric, and ocean sciences","Biochemistry and molecular biology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbab014","licenseUrl":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model"},{"id":"10.1119/10.0004155","type":"paper","title":"Diffraction Experiments with a Smart Cart","abstract":"The use of smartphones in experimental physics is by now widely accepted and documented.

Courses cover a wide array of diverse topics and can vary in terms of effort level and pedagogical approach. They have evolved from an experiment in global course interactions to offering college credit, professional certifications, professional development credits, college course supplemental material, incorporation in college campus education, and career gap–specific courses while reaching as many learners as possible. Most are associated with universities and taught by professors, produced via a partnership of universities with online learning platforms, such as edX® and Coursera. A variety of educational tools can be incorporated, such as interactive modules, video lectures, reference materials, assessments, collaborative lessons, discussion boards, and peer-reviewed assignments. Newer MOOCs feature chatbots and adaptive algorithm models that adjust to learners' prior knowledge and question responsiveness. They can be easily accessed by anyone, provided they have an internet connection, language proficiency (most are only available in English), and computer literacy (Setia et al., 2019). Many MOOCs offer an audit track, which provides access to all course materials for a limited time except graded assignments; they are typically free but learners are unable to earn a “certificate” under this option. To earn a verified certificate, learners pay a fee and must complete specified assessments, discussions, and/or other assigned learning activities.\\n\\nMillions of learners of various ages, backgrounds, interests, and goals typically enroll in these courses. As a form of e-learning, MOOCs continue to emerge as a particularly valuable strategy to address some of the training challenges experienced in developing countries by supporting efficient content delivery, decreasing costs, and increasing access (Liyanagunawardena & Aboshady, 2018). MOOCs have been shown to significantly improve outreach regarding public health concerns, as well as providing necessary training for health care professionals and the general public. The most recent report presented at the edX Virtual Forum (2020) documents >35 million learners with 110 million unique enrollments spanning 196 countries. Furthermore, MOOCs are particularly suited for addressing health topics while attracting global learners from low-resource contexts (Barteit et al., 2019). Currently, health and medicine are estimated to account for only a small percentage of MOOCs; topics have included nutrition, stress management, alternative therapies, mental health, ethics, global health, and health care leadership. Other courses are more disease- or condition-specific, such as hypertension, menopause, and pediatric injuries, as well as HIV and addiction. However, what seems to be substantially lacking are courses focused on conditions related to aging and issues impacting older adults.\\n\\nAs part of a concerted effort to address this dearth of gero-focused content, two MOOCs were launched by Salisbury University's School of Nursing in conjunction with USMx, an initiative through the University System of Maryland's William E. Kirwan Center for Academic Innovation. The two courses, titled Overview of Parkinson's Disease & Management and Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Care, were purposely designed to appeal to lay persons and caregivers, as well as health care professionals working with these patient populations. These courses include a variety of teaching modalities to enhance learner engagement, such as introductory/summary videos for each of the five modules, check your knowledge questions, web links, embedded visuals/videos, as well as video interviews with a person with Parkinson's disease and an Alzheimer's caregiver, respectively, followed by reflective discussion. The response to these self-paced, gero-focused offerings has been overwhelmingly positive, and data show the goal of reaching a wide audience with varying skills was exceeded within the first year. Collectively, there are >12,000 learners and growing, reaching more than 140 countries, with the United States only making up 15% to 20% of the enrolled population. Of these learners who self-reported demographic information for the two courses, approximately 65% are female and 35% are male and median age is 28 years. Approximately 26% have a high school diploma or less, and 24% have an advanced degree. Although these MOOCs, which launched in late 2019/early 2020, likely experienced heightened interest due to the COVID-19–induced lockdown worldwide, the far-reaching nature of these courses as a cost-effective way to introduce a widespread audience to pertinent gerontological topics of interest is markedly clear.\\n\\nEven with their growing popularity, scholarly debate continues regarding benefits versus concerns when offering free and open content to an international audience. Limitations can include low-quality or non-engaging instruction, passive learning, course difficulty, and low average completion rates despite free content (Setia et al., 2019). High drop-out rates remain a much-criticized issue (Chan et al., 2019). Suggested strategies for improving participation and completion rates while enhancing perceived value would include offering courses of shorter duration and incorporating good-quality media. Furthermore, advertising courses through multiple credible channels (including social media platforms) can spread awareness about e-learning opportunities (Setia et al., 2019). Incentives can include offering certificates, credits, or professional credit; providing learning support and learner feedback; and using data to analyze drop-out points to drive course improvements (Chan et al., 2019).\\n\\nMOOCs can provide a free and accessible way for learners to be exposed to new topics or disciplines while providing a forum to stimulate new interests and ideas. They can serve as an effective and efficient method to provide education regarding health topics while creating a diverse and interactive community of global learners. MOOCs that address issues specific to the geriatric population can go beyond disease-oriented topics to those that explore broader concerns related to aging, such as polypharmacy, health promotion, transitions in care, end-of-life decision making, and the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in optimizing care outcomes.\\n\\nAlthough MOOCs can be resource-intensive to develop, the rewards of educating a global audience can be particularly satisfying. High-quality MOOCs developed by knowledgeable faculty and/or expert health care professionals can provide a learning environment where gerontological nurses and other health care providers, as well as lay persons/caregivers from various geographic regions, cultures, and backgrounds, can connect and share experiences. Nursing faculty, in collaboration with practicing gerontological nurses, have the opportunity to provide cutting-edge MOOCs to not only enhance learning among students and health care peers to enhance practice, but also inform the global community at large about pertinent geriatric topics.","authors":["Mary C.

The project is a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. Aerial surveys with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been performed for the high-resolution mapping of a small tidal system. Flight missions were planned to obtain a Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 2 cm. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) algorithms have been used to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the site. The mapping of channel morphology and an elevation assessment on the mudflat were performed using orthomosaics, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and GNSS survey. The results highlight that the workflow adopted in this pilot work is suitable to assess the geomorphological evolution over time in a micro-tidal system. However, issues were encountered for salt marsh due to the presence of dense vegetation. The UAV-based photogrammetry approach with GNSS RTK ground surveys can hence be replicated in similar sites all over the world to evaluate restoration interventions and to develop new strategies for a better management of existing shorelines.","authors":["William Nardin","Lorie W.

It extends prior research—that is, García‐Izquierdo et al. (2018), who examine these relationships using a sample of Spanish nursing students. For this study, a survey instrument was concurrently administered to 443 accounting majors at four geographically dispersed universities. Two alternative models are tested. The first model positions resilience as an exogenous predictor, and dimensions of academic burnout antecedent to psychological distress. The results indicate a significant negative association between resilience, psychological distress, and each of the three academic burnout dimensions. In addition, emotional exhaustion and academic inefficacy have a significant positive association with psychological distress. The alternative model positions psychological distress antecedent to each of the academic burnout dimensions. The results indicate that resilience has a significant negative association with psychological distress, cynicism, and academic inefficacy, but not emotional exhaustion. Moreover, psychological distress has significant positive associations with each academic burnout dimension. In the alternative model specification, resilience is also found to moderate the association between psychological distress and academic inefficacy. This single moderating effect notwithstanding, the findings suggest that the primary role of resilience is that of a compensatory mechanism by acting as an independent exogenous predictor of distress and burnout.","authors":["David J.

Subjects randomized to resistance training groups were required to perform strength training exercises three to five days a week for 11 weeks. The exercise regimen consisted of 2-3 sets of 3-8 repetitions (80-90% of 1-repetition maximum (1 RM)) for the HI group and 3-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions (50%-70% of 1 RM) for the HV group.

As citizens and policymakers respond to these challenges, American democracy and societies worldwide are at a crossroads. In *How Democracies Die*, Levitsky and Ziblatt (Citation2018) asserted that “American democracy depends on us – the citizens of the United States. No single political leader can end a democracy; no single leader can rescue one, either” (p. 230). Can we meet this challenge of shared civic responsibilities in a highly polarized polity? Do our schools and other core institutions have the capacity and the will to inspire our children and young adults’ civility and civic purpose? Can we revive civic trust as the majority of our citizens lose confidence in our governing institutions? Will the next generation of American citizens be ready to exercise their voting rights and free speech? Will inequalities in civic engagement widen in the context of growing economic inequality? Is deliberative democracy fading in the American polity? These issues are at the core of the design, practice, and future of democratic practices in the United States and beyond. The papers in this special issue raise the saliency and the relevance of these issues while suggesting steps that civic actors – whether teachers, researchers, students, parents, taxpayers, or other members of the public – can and do take to encourage greater democratic living.\\n\\nThe worrisome state of American democracy calls for a systematic examination of civic education and civic capacity, the foundational pillars of democratic life. Mounk (Citation2018) found that only one-third of millennials (versus two-thirds of those born in the 1930s and 1940s) thought living in a democratic society was very important. Studies (e.g., CCSSO, Citation2018) show curricula are narrowing due to high stakes accountability, often excluding or marginalizing civics education. Schools can play an important role in increasing civic engagement generally and decreasing gaps in civic engagement that exist (Levinson, Citation2012), but civic opportunities are often inequitably distributed within schools (Kahne & Middaugh, Citation2008).\\n\\nIn a political context shifting toward ideological polarization (Feldman et al., Citation2018) and populism (Roth, Citation2017) and away from transparent and public accountability around the globe, including in democracies, there is increasing interest in reaffirming democratic practices. In the US, part of the rationale for public schools has been to prepare people to be democratic citizens, both historically (Dewey, Citation1916) and currently (Gould et al., Citation2011). Given the longstanding commitment to civic education and the current urgency, this special issue offers a comprehensive, current understanding of the state of the field.\\n\\nCollectively, this special issue integrates theoretical and empirical work on civic education, civic capacity, and democratic practices. We view civic education as a set of learning goals shaped by the framework of liberal democracy (e.g., Dewey, Citation1916; Gutmann, Citation1987). Particular attention is given to the concepts and practice of action civics, a type of guided experiential civics education (Ballard et al., Citation2016; Cohen et al., Citation2018; Pope et al., Citation2011). Strengthening civic education will contribute to vibrant civic capacity, a concept commonly promoted by political scientists (e.g., Henig et al., Citation1999; Orr & Rogers, Citation2011; Putnam, Citation2000; Skocpol, Citation2003; Stone et al., Citation2001). Civic capacity departs from business-as-usual politics and fosters cross-sector collaboration to address a common challenge at the system-wide level. Examining the connection between civic education and civic capacity highlights inequalities in civic learning and the extent to which educational inadequacy may affect civic engagement, such as electoral turnouts and parental involvement in schooling issues (Orr et al., Citation2016).\\n\\nThis special issue examines these topics as they relate to issues across a range of settings in the US and internationally. Our authors report on work being done at scale with diverse populations and address issues that are particularly relevant to education policy, politics, capacity building, and practice.\\n\\nOur first paper, by Fitzgerald et al. (Citation2021), offers a systematic review of the last decade of civics education research in the United States. Of the 648 studies reviewed, almost 70% focused on civic curricula, instructional practices, and learning outcomes. Civic skills and capacities and civic identities accounted for only 19% and 14% of the studies respectively. The authors found very few studies that incorporated marginalized voices in politics and addressed increasing political polarization. The paper identifies directions for future research that could support efforts to broaden youth civic participation and decrease political polarization.\\n\\nThe next several papers in the issue focus on civic education and democratic practices in schools. In the United States, Littenberg-Tobias (Citation2021) explores relationships between active learning in civics and students’ civic knowledge using NAEP civics data. He found that active learning experiences were positively associated with increases in student knowledge, but the overall effect sizes were fairly small. However, after applying a different method for measuring active learning that emphasized quality not quantity of experience and taking into account potential overuse of activities, the effect size was substantially larger.\\n\\nDiGiacomo et al. (Citation2021) studied teachers’ civic education experiences and perspectives in a politically and demographically diverse school district. How teachers conceptualized civic education varied widely, from preparing students to be critical thinkers, to teaching how to be good “citizens,” to showing them how to exercise their voice in civic activities. Sociopolitical contexts and other external challenges shaped how teachers integrated civics into their classes and classroom practices. Importantly, while teachers felt strongly about supporting students’ civic development, they lacked systematic support for doing so routinely.\\n\\nSome papers explored nonprofits’ work on civic education. McAvoy and McAvoy (Citation2021) studied the Close Up Washington program and reported on the differential polarization of high school students who experience political discussion in deliberative small groups versus debate activities and offer ideas for reducing polarization. The lessons about how discussion strategies impact student polarization are especially important for teachers who engage controversial or contentious issues in what can be already polarized classrooms.\\n\\nAndes et al. (Citation2021) reflect on over a decade of Generation Citizen’s school-based programming, highlighting three important qualities for a successful nonpartisan program: local focus, diversity, and community and student voice. Their attention to being political in a nonpartisan way is particularly important for pedagogical approaches like action civics, which encourage student voice, agency, and action. This can inform the future of action civics education in schools, regardless of the political leanings of the school’s area.\\n\\nDrawing on anti-racist theory and the knowledge base on community organizing, Kirshner et al. (Citation2021) propose a framework for scaling and sustaining justice-centered civic learning. Their theory of change is illuminated by an initiative sponsored by the Denver Public Schools that raised the awareness of students and teachers on injustices and broadened student engagement in action research and policy change. Among the facilitating features on critical civic engagement included teacher buy-in, organizational and content alignment, and student leadership development. Lessons learned from this case study have implications for moving action civics beyond merely a checklist.\\n\\nThe issue also includes research from Cuba and Israel. Dawley-Carr (Citation2021) explores Cuba’s K-12 citizenship education model and its current challenges. Historically, Cuban citizenship education, from its organizational structure to its civics curriculum, emphasized work in the planned economy as a central civic duty. With emerging privatization, today’s Cuban youth face challenges to meeting this duty. The paper offers in-depth case studies of youth whose lived experiences showed varying educational and vocational pathways with shifting civic mindedness.\\n\\nCohen and Eyal (Citation2021) study cross-sector alliances – partnerships between public schools and groups outside the formal education system – in Israeli high school civics courses. Interviews with teachers engaged in such partnerships yield valuable insights into how the civic ideology of outside groups intersects with and influences ideas of citizenship presented in classrooms. Cohen and Eyal warn of the potential for cross-sector alliances to reify particular, dominant conceptions of citizenship at the potential expense of marginalized groups.\\n\\nWe conclude with papers focused on civic capacity and democratic practices in school districts. Morel (Citation2021) outlines how civic engagement and the politics of citizenship helped transform the public schools in Union City, New Jersey. He notes that the unique political constituency of Cuban Americans at a time that the state was led by Republicans (who were interested in Cuban Americans as potential Republican voters) offered the school district more flexibility in improving their school system than other districts, which led to sustained improvements. As polarization and politicization worsen across societies, it will be important to put politics aside (and not rely on state politicians deciding that there is political alignment) in order to support community engagement in school system transformation.\\n\\nCollins (Citation2021) brings nuanced findings to an important question: Who should be in charge of schools? Through a novel video-based survey experiment, Collins questions the otherwise straightforward finding that stakeholders generally prefer school boards over other forms of control such as school-site councils or state and federal bodies. He offers important clarifications about what kind of stakeholder prefers school boards. He also explores evidence and implications of stakeholder desires to engage with school boards directly. School stakeholders want opportunities for community members to engage in the deliberative democratic practice of school board decisions. This finding bodes well for broader efforts to promote democratic practice across the landscape of public schools.\\n\\nEach article offers an important contribution to the field of civics education at a time when popular discourse around civics, citizenship, and democracy more generally seems despondent. Concerns of polarization, the lack of constructive discourse, and increasing isolation inside partisan “echo chambers” have been particularly visible in recent years and concern all of us who are committed to the tenets of democracy and the practice of democratic education. We invite readers to approach each article as an exploration of a particular piece of this larger challenge and hope that readers will engage with the ideas as they exist across and between the separate pieces. There is no single approach that will safeguard the future of civic education and democratic living. Instead, educators at every level must be prepared with the tools and dispositions to support a broad approach to this work.\\n\\nThree themes across this issue reveal both immediate classroom needs and future goals for educators and researchers: equity, polarization, and the role of curricula and pedagogy in promoting citizenship and civic action. These themes highlight the importance of schools as spaces for developing and practicing democracy in ways that can impact broader communities.\\n\\nMany of these articles share an interest in issues of equity, and the different experiences marginalized students may have both as students and civic actors. Working toward equity will include ensuring that all students have equitable access to high-quality civics education in schools and that they also have equitable access to civic engagement opportunities and civic power beyond school as well. As the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many inequities, including gaps in what educational opportunities youth experience, it will be important to closely monitor equity in civic education, civic capacity, and civic life.\\n\\nSchools can respond to the realities of polarization in national politics, and can also model consensus building, compromise and learning across differences, and be part of the solution toward reducing political polarization. Can schools provide a safe space where ideas on democracy and governance can be debated without repercussions? Will schools teach students how to earn respect and be respected when political discourse occurs? Addressing these issues in our schools will have broad ramifications for our next generation of leaders.\\n\\nWhether implicit or explicit, teachers offer certain ideas about citizenship as they craft curricula and/or as they transform provided curricula into enacted classroom activities. The pedagogies of citizenship can enable classrooms to serve as important sites for dialogues and deliberations about what democracy means and what democratic participation entails. While we agree that schools are the appropriate venue for such dialogues, we are also mindful of ongoing debates regarding not just types of citizenship, but the ways in which curricula open or close discussions of the relationships between teacher, student, and state. We hope, too, that future research will investigate those relationships as they move outside of the classroom, to interrogate the practices of deliberative democracy and voting beyond the school.\\n\\nWe are at a critical juncture: This decade will be formative for supporting democratic responses to overcoming the sizable challenges, including widening inequities, that have emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. Promoting collaborative (versus polarized), equitable civic participation to sustain societies is essential.","authors":["Alexander Pope","Kenneth K. Wong","Alison K.

Today, there is a wide body of empirical evidence that demonstrates the benefits of partnering outweigh the resources devoted to its implementation. Despite such outstanding outcomes, collaborative partnering is still new, misunderstood, underutilized, and evolving for airport construction projects that entail greater complexity and increased risks due to a high number of stakeholders and additional sector-specific regulations. The objectives of this study are to describe the state-of-practice regarding partnering in the aviation construction industry and offer insights about its use. A comprehensive survey of industry professionals representing DOTs, airports, and others involved in construction aviation projects in the United States helps capture partnering trends across the industry. Findings show that participants with experience in partnered-aviation construction projects perceive higher improvement of safety and reduced claims offering greater rewards. However, these projects are operating as late adopters of partnering with many at the initial stages of implementation. The main contribution of the paper to the body of knowledge is that partnering is suitable for airport projects regardless of the project delivery method followed, budget size, or partnering intensity levels. Those with greater experience with partnering under design-bid-build project delivery methods are more likely to perceive higher improvements. Furthermore, it increases trust and strengthens the relationships between organizations. The findings are significant as they bring attention to team integration practices for improved outcomes via the underutilized partnering in an industry niche where stakeholder and risk management are key to project success.\\n\\n### Metrics\\n- **Total Downloads:** 713  \\n- **Last 12 Months:** 137  \\n- **Total Citations:** 7  \\n- **Last 12 Months:** 5  \\n\\n### Acknowledgments\\nThe authors extend their sincere gratitude to the numerous industry professionals who contributed to the study with data and insights.

Drawing on data from Iranian Azerbaijanis, I argue that availability and accessibility of linguistic/semiotic resources, and their categorizations as languages or language varieties, are constrained by participants’ chronotopization histories. That is, the scaled images participants develop through socialization about different time–space frames and the peoples, relations, discourses, and resources therein guide their language use both from and about particular contexts. I discuss the utility of spatiotemporal understandings of repertoires of resources and normalcies in capturing the variability, dynamicity, and complexity of semiotic practices and also in addressing the controversies among scholars regarding the ‘realness’ of languages and hybridity of multilingual practices. Through decentralizing language(s) and foregrounding context(s) and contextualization, I argue, the chronotope enables us to analyze not only social actors’ hybrid utilization of semiotic resources in meaning-making processes, but also their language ideologies and language-ideological practices, which rely heavily on the perceptions of languages as discrete systems.","authors":["Farzad Karimzad"],"journal":"Applied Linguistics","datePublished":"2021-1-27","aiKeywords":["Language ideologies","Semiotic resources","Dynamicity and complexity of language practices","Contextualization","Multilingual practices","Chronotopic analysis","Language use"],"facultyKeywords":["Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","Humanities, other","Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics nec","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences","Humanities and humanistic studies","Ethnic studies","Social sciences, other","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Social sciences","Linguistics","Area studies","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Sociology, general","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Humanities","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics","Hispanic Latin American languages, literatures, and linguistics","Theological and ministerial studies","Interdisciplinary computer sciences","Applied linguistics"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/applin/amaa053","licenseUrl":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model"},{"id":"10.1242/jeb.236877","type":"paper","title":"The bony tale of the bonytail's bony tail","abstract":"When you picture a fish that spends its whole life constantly swimming at high speed, you probably see a tuna or marlin – something that cruises miles and.

However, one area that remains understudied is the role played by CSR practices in managing corporate reputation under conditions of supply chain risk. To answer this research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using quantitative analysis of both primary and secondary data collected from organizations dispersed globally. The results highlight that under conditions of supply chain network disruption risk, CSR practices play an important role in enabling firms to manage the negative impact of such risk drivers on corporate reputation. The study further suggests that CSR practices positively impact supply chain risk management (SCRM) practices and are a necessary condition for SCRM practices to be effective in improving corporate reputation of organizations.","authors":["Nitya P.

However, few empirical studies have measured the extent to which this phenomenon holds across the regulatory system as a whole. Using a novel U.S. state panel data set spanning the period 2000–2014, we estimate the effect of U.S. federal regulation on state‐level mortality. We find that a 1% increase in federal regulation of state economies is associated with an increase in an index of state mortality of between 0.53% and 1.35%. These findings are robust to the form of mortality measure, choice of covariates, and the inclusion/exclusion of various regions, states, and industries. We also provide an update of the “cost‐per‐life saved cutoff,” which is the counterproductive risk threshold for expenditures. We find that expenditures in excess of $38.6 million (2019 dollars) per life saved can be expected to increase mortality risk. This article fills an important gap in the empirical literature and boosts the credibility of mortality risk analysis, whereby public policymakers weigh both the expected lives saved and lost due to a proposed regulation or other policy.","authors":["James Broughel","Dustin Chambers"],"journal":"Risk Analysis","datePublished":"2021-6-23","aiKeywords":["Counterproductive Effects of Regulations","Mortality Risk Assessment","Impact of Federal Regulation on Public Health","Empirical Validation of Regulatory Effects","State-Level Health Outcomes"],"facultyKeywords":["Public policy analysis, general","Health sciences","Public health, general","Environmental natural resource economics","Public policy analysis","Economics","Econometrics and quantitative economics","Public health","Social sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.13774","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1242/jeb.241661","type":"paper","title":"Covariation among multimodal components in the courtship display of the túngara frog","abstract":"Communication systems often include a variety of components, including those that span modalities, which may facilitate detection and decision-making. For example, female túngara frogs and fringe-lipped bats generally rely on acoustic mating signals to find male túngara frogs in a mating or foraging context, respectively. However, two additional cues (vocal sac inflation and water ripples) can enhance detection and choice behavior. To date, we do not know the natural variation and covariation of these three components. To address this, we made detailed recordings of calling males, including call amplitude, vocal sac volume and water ripple height, in 54 frogs (2430 calls). We found that all three measures correlated, with the strongest association between the vocal sac volume and call amplitude. We also found that multimodal models predicted the mass of calling males better than unimodal models. These results demonstrate how multimodal components of a communication system relate to each other and provide an important foundation for future studies on how receivers integrate and compare complex displays.","authors":["Kimberly L.

Aerobic exercise is an essential component in the management and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to determine and evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise on fasting blood glucose, Insulin, Insulin resistance, Glycosylated hemoglobin (Hemoglobin A1C), Lipid profile as important indicators of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Methods:This research is a systematic review and meta-analysis that was conducted in 2021. For the present study, databases, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, science of Web, SID, Magiran and Google Scholar from 2010 to 2021, were searched along with keywords. After the initial screening, the full text of the articles was evaluated and the articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. A total of 120 articles were reviewed, of which 16 articles met the criteria for entering the systematic review and meta-analysis. Accordingly, 710 people with fatty liver disease were divided into two groups of control and experimental group of 307 and 403 people, respectively. The mean age of the subjects in the present study was 52±10 years. The intervention effects were evaluated using the mean difference (MD) and the random effects model. Data were analyzed using effect size tests, bias analysis and heterogeneity analysis and by STATA software.Results:Meta-analysis results indicated that endurance training in general significantly reduced glucose levels (P = 0.004, SDM = -0.26, SE = 0.09), insulin (P = 0.01, SDM = -0.29, SE = 0.11), HOMA-IR (P = 0.01, SDM = -0.28, SE = 0.11), Hba1c (P = 0.001, SDM = -0.33, SE = 0.12), triglycerides (P = 0.02, SDM = -0.31, SE = 0.13) and LDL (P = 0.03, SDM = -0.21, SE = 0.1). The results of meta-analysis did not show a significant effect on HDL levels after aerobic exercise in patients with fatty liver (P = 0.97, SDM = 0, SE = 0.09).Conclusion:Endurance training improves the levels of glucose, insulin, Hba1c, Homa-IR, triglyceride, and LDL; although, there was no significant change in HDL levels due to endurance training. However, there is still a need for more and higher quality research in this area.","authors":["Timothy Baghurst","Mohammad Faramarzi","Mahdi Ghafari","Masoud Moghaddam","Sajedeh Sadeghiyan"],"journal":"","datePublished":"","aiKeywords":["Importance of endurance training for health","Management and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","Effects of aerobic exercise on metabolic indicators","Need for further research in exercise-related health interventions"],"facultyKeywords":["Health sciences, other","Medical clinical science","Biological and biomedical sciences","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Exercise physiology and kinesiology","Health sciences, general","Health sciences","Health services research","Public health, general","Biochemistry and molecular biology","Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology","Biochemistry","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Public health","Molecular biology","Oncology and cancer biology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-573993/v1","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1002/ecs2.3640","type":"paper","title":"Leveraging the NEON Airborne Observation Platform for socio‐environmental systems research","abstract":"During the 21st century, human–environment interactions will increasingly expose both systems to risks, but also yield opportunities for improvement as we gain insight into these complex, coupled systems. Human–environment interactions operate over multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring large data volumes of multi‐resolution information for analysis. Climate change, land‐use change, urbanization, and wildfires, for example, can affect regions differently depending on ecological and socioeconomic structures. The relative scarcity of data on both humans and natural systems at the relevant extent can be prohibitive when pursuing inquiries into these complex relationships. We explore the value of multitemporal, high‐density, and high‐resolution LiDAR, imaging spectroscopy, and digital camera data from the National Ecological Observatory Network’s Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) for Socio‐Environmental Systems (SES) research. In addition to providing an overview of NEON AOP datasets and outlining specific applications for addressing SES questions, we highlight current challenges and provide recommendations for the SES research community to improve and expand its use of this platform for SES research. The coordinated, nationwide AOP remote sensing data, collected annually over the next 30 yr, offer exciting opportunities for cross‐site analyses and comparison, upscaling metrics derived from LiDAR and hyperspectral datasets across larger spatial extents, and addressing questions across diverse scales. Integrating AOP data with other SES datasets will allow researchers to investigate complex systems and provide urgently needed policy recommendations for socio‐environmental challenges. We urge the SES research community to further explore questions and theories in social and economic disciplines that might leverage NEON AOP data.","authors":["Jennifer Jensen","Guillermo E.

There has been a wealth of literature on dynamic capabilities; however, very few are at interfirm level and even fewer are conducted in the healthcare industry. Grounded in information processing view, this study contributes to the literature by examining interfirm dynamic capabilities in the context of healthcare delivery networks. It proposes the interfirm dynamic capabilities as a form of information processing capability with five dimensions: sensing, learning, coordination, collective mind and partner development. Using data collected from healthcare delivery networks, this study explores the impact of interfirm dynamic capabilities on hospitals’ performance. The findings suggest that the fit between a healthcare delivery network's interfirm dynamic capabilities and information processing requirements will improve its operational capabilities, which will lead to better performance.KEYWORDS: Information processing viewinterfirm dynamic capabilitiesinformation processing requirementinformation processing capacity; healthcare delivery networkDisclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).","authors":["Wendy Wang","Xiao Zhang","Yun Wu"],"journal":"Journal of Decision Systems","datePublished":"2021-7-21","aiKeywords":["information processing capabilities","interfirm dynamic capabilities","supply chain responsiveness","healthcare delivery networks","operational performance in healthcare"],"facultyKeywords":["Business","Health sciences, other","Health sciences","Health sciences, general","Medical, biomedical, and health informatics","Health services research","Public health, general","Business administration and management nec","Business administration and management","Public health"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12460125.2021.1947945","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1002/dys.1690","type":"paper","title":"K‐2 principal knowledge (not leadership) matters for dyslexia intervention","abstract":"Kindergarten through second‐grade elementary schools that best serve students with dyslexia have principals who are knowledgeable about dyslexia and understand the best practices for providing intervention for students with dyslexia. In this study, three styles of leadership were examined to understand the implication that leadership has on intervention for dyslexia: transformational, instructional, and integrated leadership. However, many students in elementary schools have difficulty learning to read despite good leadership by the principal, with 5–20% of students being diagnosed with dyslexia. While these students need phonetic, multisensory intervention to build necessary reading skills, this study found that many principals lack knowledge of this specialized instruction. The purpose of this research was to explore variables that determine the school‐based level of appropriate intervention for students with dyslexia. A questionnaire assessing leadership skills, knowledge, and beliefs about dyslexia, preparation in reading disorders and/or dyslexia received from degree programs and professional development, and services provided to students with dyslexia was given to K‐2 principals serving in schools across the United States. Results indicated that regardless of leadership style, principals who have greater knowledge and more correct beliefs about dyslexia provide more appropriate school‐based services for students with dyslexia.

SIT is a time-efficient strategy to improve aerobic performance similar to moderate intensity continuous training (MICT). There has been a relative absence of studies on neuromuscular adaptations of SIT.\\n\\n**PURPOSE**: To compare the effects of stationary air biking, utilizing high-volume MICT and low-volume SIT (i.e., ultrashort-SIT [US], short-SIT [SS]) on neuromuscular system.\\n\\n**METHODS**: Thirty recreationally active females were randomly assigned to MICT (n = 10), US (n = 10), and SS (n = 10) groups. The intervention consisted of 3 d/wk for 4 wks. MICT was performed by 30 min of cycling at 75% of maximal heart rate reserve, while SIT (i.e., US, SS) consisted of 3 sets of 8 intervals at maximal effort intensity. SS and US were performed with 20s:10s and 10s:5s work-to-rest ratios and provided with 5- and 2.5-min recovery periods between sets, respectively. Muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) and echo intensity (EI) of rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) were measured by ultrasound system. Isometric strength testing protocol consisted of 3 maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC). During each contraction, surface electromyography (sEMG) and torque signals were recorded to assess sEMG amplitude (RMS) of RF and VL as well as peak torque (PT). All variables were measured before and after intervention and were analyzed with 2-way mixed factorial ANOVAs. Moreover, average total work (TW) during 12 sessions was recorded and analyzed with one-way ANOVA.\\n\\n**RESULTS**: There were significant (p < 0.05) differences in TW (MICT: 142.7 ± 31.5 cal., US: 52.6 ± 10.0 cal., SS: 92.3 ± 7.8 cal.) between groups. All groups significantly (p < 0.05) improved mCSA of RF (MICT: 9.0 ± 1.0 to 9.5 ± 1.1 cm2, US: 9.9 ± 3.5 to 10.6 ± 3.6 cm2, SS: 9.0 ± 1.9 to 9.7 ± 1.5 cm2) and VL (MICT: 20.0 ± 2.3 to 20.6 ± 2.1 cm2, US: 20.8 ± 5.1 to 22.5 ± 5.2 cm2, SS: 19.6 ± 2.6 to 21.4 ± 3.8 cm2). No significant (p > 0.05) differences observed in EI values as well as RMS and PT during MVIC.\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**: Despite no significant improvements in neural activation and isometric strength, all groups similarly improved muscular morphology of RF and VL by performing SIT on a stationary air bike. These findings suggest that SIT can elicit muscular morphological adaptations with a shorter time commitment.\\n\\nCopyright © 2021 by the American College of Sports Medicine","authors":["Carlos A.

Conspecifics can recognize these signals and behaviorally respond in sex‐specific ways. However, we know little about how males and females might differ in their responses to signals from individuals or how the sexes might differ in their ability to recognize their own identity. Such signals of identity are important because they can modulate the behavior of receivers, and allow for responses related to aggression, territory maintenance, affiliation, and reproduction. To assess how males and females might differ in their responses to individual familiar and novel social signals, and their own individual signals compared to novel same‐sex conspecifics, we tested southern giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei) using a habituation–discrimination paradigm. Only females showed individual recognition and discriminated among males, preferring novel males. Females also discriminated between their own scent and a novel conspecific odor. Males did not discriminate or demonstrate individual recognition. Male and female differences in response to opposite‐sex odors demonstrated that males do not discriminate between familiar and novel reproductively available females, but females discriminate and prefer to investigate novel males.","authors":["Angela R.

In other circumstances, borders are highly rigid, difficult to cross and can demarcate vast economic and social disparities. The widely differing circumstances related to border creation and maintenance have deep effects that are worthy of social work attention and engagement. There has been serious attention to issues of globalisation, immigration and human rights in the social work literature. Our focus on borders is related to, but distinct from these issues, and therefore, has something unique to offer. Increased globalisation has led to a major reconceptualisation in our understanding of borders. The COVID-19 epidemic demonstrates the limited relevance of borders in some circumstances (spreading of the virus) but the heightened relevance of borders in other circumstances (travel restrictions). Social work practitioners have a role in framing the understanding of borders and resulting policies. Our focus is to address the question: How has social work engaged with border issues?

However, it is still challenging to quantify team-level game performance because there is no strong ground truth. Thus, a team cannot receive feedback in a standardized way. The aim of this study was twofold. First, we designed a metric called LAX-Score to quantify a collegiate lacrosse team's athletic performance. Next, we explored the relationship between our proposed metric and practice sensing features for performance enhancement. To derive the metric, we utilized feature selection and weighted regression. Then, the proposed metric was statistically validated on over 700 games from the last three seasons of NCAA Division I women's lacrosse. We also explored our biometric sensing dataset obtained from a collegiate team's athletes over the course of a season. We then identified the practice features that are most correlated with high-performance games. Our results indicate that LAX-Score provides insight into athletic performance beyond wins and losses. Moreover, though COVID-19 has stalled implementation, the collegiate team studied applied our feature outcomes to their practices, and the initial results look promising with regard to better performance.","authors":["Shuangquan Wang","Minglong Sun","Ken Koltermann","Erik Korem","Gang Zhou","Zhenming Liu","Woosub Jung","Scott Kuehn","Amanda Watson"],"journal":"Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies","datePublished":"2021-9-14","aiKeywords":["Impact of COVID-19 on sports practices","Team performance measurement","Relationship between practice features and performance","Machine learning in sports science","Quantification of athletic performance"],"facultyKeywords":["Computer and information sciences","Computer science","Health sciences, other","Health sciences","Computer and information sciences, other","Health sciences, general","Electrical engineering and computer science","Artificial intelligence","Informatics and information technology ","Computer science and engineering","Exercise science and kinesiology","Computer and information sciences, general","Interdisciplinary computer sciences","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3478076","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1649/0010-065x-75.2.382","type":"paper","title":"Relationship of Dung Beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae and Geotrupidae) Abundance and Parasite Control in Cattle on Pastures throughout Maryland","abstract":"Cattle treated with chemicals to control parasites can fecally excrete residues that have the potential to adversely affect local assemblages of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae).

In this article, we present a critical methodological analysis of the challenges and benefits of using Toulmin’s argumentation model in mathematics education to assess the debriefing phase of lesson study. During debriefing sessions, teachers offer arguments about how to improve teaching that are grounded in observations of students’ learning. Toulmin’s model provides a means to analyze the structure of such arguments. Using an empirical example, we illustrate challenges of using the model, such as determining appropriate grain sizes for data and claims, evaluating qualifiers, recognizing multiple categories of backing, identifying implicit warrants, and deciding between the individual or the group as a unit of analysis. We also discuss benefits such as being able to systematically compare mathematics teachers’ pedagogical arguments against one another, assess attainment of debriefing session goals, and characterize group discursive dynamics. Despite the challenges of using the Toulmin model, we conclude that it provides a useful framework for systematic analysis of lesson study debriefing sessions. The present article can help researchers anticipate and address challenges of conducting Toulmin-based qualitative analyses of debriefing session discourse.

In the present study, the behavioral responses ofS. invictaworkers to surfaces treated with insecticides were investigated. Toxicological tests showed that beta-cypermethrin had the highest contact toxicity (with the lowest LC50value) among nine tested insecticides, followed by thiamethoxam, fipronil, indoxacarb, chlorfenapyr, rotenone, spinetoram, avermectin, and chlorantraniliprole. In the laboratory, surfaces treated beta-cypermethrin or rotenone significantly reduced the number of foraging ants. In addition,S. invictaworkers transported significantly more particles (measured in weight and/or covered area) onto surfaces treated with fipronil (50, 500, and 5000 ppm), rotenone (5000 ppm), or avermectin (5000 ppm) compared with the controls. Similarly, these insecticides significantly triggered the particle-covering behavior of ants in the field. We hypothesized that such behaviors would reduce the contact toxicity of insecticides againstS. invicta.When the surfaces treated with fipronil or rotenone (500 or 5000 ppm) were artificiality covered with particles,S. invictahad significantly higher LT50values compared with insecticide-treated surfaces without particles.This study provides the first evidence thatS. invictaworkers can perform particle-covering behavior to reduce the toxicity of certain insecticides, which constitutes a unique insecticide-resistance strategy in ants.","authors":["Chao Wen","Xuan Chen","Yinghao He","Tao Ma","Jian Chen","Liming Sheng","Lei Wang","Jianlong Zhang","Xiujun Wen","Cai Wang","Jiacheng Cai","Ying Feng","Zhong Wang"],"journal":"","datePublished":"","aiKeywords":["Insect behavior","Ant ecology","Insecticide resistance","Toxicology","Environmental pest control"],"facultyKeywords":["Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Ecology","Toxicology","Pharmacology","Biological and biomedical sciences","Pharmacology and toxicology","Animal sciences","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences nec","Epidemiology and biostatistics","Microbiology and immunology","Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Microbiology, general","Ecology and evolutionary biology","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-821548/v1","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.3390/rs13214207","type":"paper","title":"Seasonality and Characterization Mapping of Restored Tidal Marsh by NDVI Imageries Coupling UAVs and Multispectral Camera","abstract":"Salt marsh evolution is strongly affected by tidal processes and ecology, which regulate sediment accretion and erosional rates. A balance between marsh erosion and deposition in a restored tidal wetland is crucial for analyzing restoration strategies to adopt in a natural context. Here, we present an integrated approach monitoring salt marsh seasonal changes over several months in a microtidal restored salt marsh of the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island (MD, USA). The project is undertaken at a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is being used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. We flew an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with an RGB and a multispectral camera to obtain a high-resolution map of the planimetric position of vegetation and to monitor the health of the marsh vegetation in diverse seasons. Due to its extension of 400 m by 400 m, a total of four flight plans were necessary to cover the entire marsh flying at a 40 m altitude obtaining a 2 cm Ground Sample Distance (GSD). This technique provides reliable results at a very low cost, enabling an accurate assessment of the marsh platforms to be conducted over time, due to both the very high spatial resolution and the precise georeferencing of the images for the comparisons. Our results show seasonal variability in the two dominant species colonizing the low marsh, Spartina alterniflora, and high marsh, Sporobolus pumilus. While the lower marshes showed a higher variability along seasons, the up-land vegetation showed persistent green foliage during cold seasons. Detecting salt marsh evolution and seasonality coupled with field measurements can help to improve the accuracy of hydrodynamic and sediment transport models. Understanding the drivers of salt marsh evolution is vital for informing restoration practices and designs, in order to improve coastal resilience, and develop and coastal management strategies.","authors":["Michela Quitadamo","William Nardin","Iacopo Vona","Corinne Corbau","Alberto Pellegrinelli","Lorie W.

Some methods, such as the use of beehives, chili fences and electric fences, seem to reduce, but not eliminate, human/elephant conflict and property loss (Karidozo et al., 2006). However, these methods require permanent infrastructure and are difficult to deploy quickly. As with most human/wildlife conflict, it is individual elephants, not the species as a whole, that are responsible for this conflict (ibid.). Elephants have large home ranges, and these individuals can shift the locus of their activity from one site to another. When conflict occurs, the most common solution is to kill the elephant (Karidozo & Osborn, 2015), even though both species of African (Loxodonta africana) and Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants are currently endangered. Here we present a case study of an alternate method to killing, disruptive darting, that can be deployed quickly on elephants visiting a location where they are not desired, with obvious ethical and conservation benefits.\\nThe subject of this study is a male elephant ~35 years old, who carries a GPS collar as part of a larger study. His home range includes the town of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, a popular tourist destination. Located within Victoria Falls National Park, the town’s tourism areas and residential properties connect directly to the surrounding wildlife areas. Therefore, it is common to observe wildlife traveling close to humans and their properties – sometimes even walking downtown during the daylight.\\nIn July 2018, our subject began to feed on trees near the Victoria Falls Baobab Elementary School, which caused concerns when children were playing in the school yard. The school contacted the Zimbabwe Parks & Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks), requesting he be ‘removed’ from their property. In an effort to keep the bull alive, and the children safe, ZimParks allowed us to anesthetize the animal and apply concentrated chili wax (>150,000 Scoville units) on sensitive parts of his body (avoiding the eyes). Based on human reactions to the wax, this would have caused non-lethal, temporary but intense discomfort, lasting 45–90 min (Osborn and Karidozo, pers. comm.).\\nThe bull approached within 375 m of the school buildings on three consecutive days immediately before the application of the wax, spending most of each day there. After application he immediately left and stayed away from the area around the school for 1 year and 2 months, never entering the school yard nor approaching closer than 375 m. After this period of complete avoidance, he came within 375 m of the school only three times, in September and October 2020. These visits were always during the night when no humans were present. This nocturnal behavior is consistent with other studies about elephants avoiding humans (Shaffer et al., 2019). In the 2 years after the mitigation, he has yet to approach within 250 m of the school.\\nHowever, while he largely avoided the location of the mitigation event for over 2 years, and still seems to be avoiding humans in that area by visiting only at night, he did not generalize this avoidance to all humans, since he still visited other parts of the town, when people were present, during this period.\\nThe movements of the bull 8 months before the application of the wax to 29 months afterward (Langbauer et al., 2021) are summarized on a story map located at: [https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b5fecacad6b544afb4afae42a0532089](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b5fecacad6b544afb4afae42a0532089).\\nThus, this disruptive darting, while having notable implementation costs in terms of personnel and materials, produced a long-term effect that benefits the conservation of elephants and reduces human–elephant conflict. This may make the costs comparable to installing and maintaining infrastructure solutions like bee hives or fencing over a comparable period. Disruptive darting can be deployed quickly, and it keeps alive endangered elephants that would otherwise be killed. There is also the potential, yet to be explored, that an elephant initially treated with disruptive darting may associate the smell of capsicum with the experience, and thus be deterred by less invasive and less expensive mitigation methods, such as burning chili-infused dung bricks.\\nIn addition to its practical benefits, the method described here has implications for the study of the cognitive behavior of elephants. Elephants are known to have excellent spatial memory (Polansky et al., 2015) and the ability to discriminate between humans whom they perceive as a threat and those whom they perceive as safe (McComb et al., 2014). Our study is consistent with these findings, in that the elephant seemed to associate the unpleasant event with a specific location, and perhaps with people at that location, rather than people in general.

The present study examined the unique relation of each humor style with psychological well-being with a focus on understanding mechanisms of adjustment under highly stressful conditions. Ninety-nine parents of children with disabilities were surveyed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in March 2020, and 79 parents completed follow-up surveys in July 2020. As predicted, at T1, self-enhancing humor was associated with less psychological distress and greater family satisfaction, self-defeating humor was associated with greater distress, and aggressive humor was associated with lower family satisfaction. Moreover, affiliative humor predicted decreased psychological distress over time, whereas self-defeating humor predicted increased psychological distress and decreased family satisfaction over time. Relations were largely mediated by caregiver positive reappraisal, family efforts to reframe daily disability-related challenges, and negative social interactions. Future research should further examine the influence of caregiver humor styles on family dynamics, family reframing norms, and caregiving efficacy.","authors":["Heidi L.

The 2020 Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education Standards for Professional Athletic Training Programs require students to apply concepts of quality improvement to provide athletic training care and deliver excellent patient outcomes. As such, programs may be looking for strategies to view students' clinical experiences through a lens of quality improvement.\\n\\n## Objective:\\nTo introduce the Critical Assessment and Reflection on Experience (CARE) form, which is a novel clinical education tool that assesses student clinical skills using critical reflection and quality improvement concepts.\\n\\n## Background:\\nHistorically, students have demonstrated achievement by comparing their skill performance with a competency checklist. Typically, the skills assessed, and the level of achievement expected progress to allow learning over time. However, current athletic training clinical education literature has shifted to promote experiential learning, critical thinking, and active reflection to develop competence.\\n\\n## Description:\\nStudents complete the CARE form after patient encounters or other clinical experiences. The form requires students to practice documentation and communication skills, but also to critically reflect on performance by applying quality improvement, patient safety, and evidence-based practice concepts.\\n\\n## Clinical Advantage(s):\\nThe form holds advantages for multiple stakeholders, including students, preceptors, and program administrators. The CARE form encourages students to engage in authentic patient interactions rather than relying on contrived learning experiences. By encouraging live patient encounters, this tool results in less burden on preceptors to create additional opportunities for students. Program administrators can use the tool to incorporate quality improvement standards meaningfully into the curriculum. Additionally, the CARE form creates opportunity to document program assessment.\\n\\n## Conclusion(s):\\nProfessional programs should consider implementing the CARE form as a clinical experience assessment tool to develop students' quality improvement and critical thinking skills when providing athletic training services.","authors":["Meredith J.

An extensive literature on affect balance suggests that it is not only positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) alone that affect well‐being; rather it is the balance between them that matters. We use experience sampling methods and polynomial regression to test the notion that daily PA and NA at work, along with their interactive and nonlinear effects, predict employee well‐being after work. In a sample of working adults, we find that affect balance—the dynamic interplay between daily PA and NA—at work was differentially associated with various indices of well‐being: PA, NA, and the interaction between them predicted physical and mental health. Affect balance at work also predicted life satisfaction, but only for those low on trait affect balance. Detailed examination of the joint effects of PA, NA, and the balance between them reveals that high PA at work is most important for life satisfaction, whereas both low NA and high PA are important for health. Low NA plays an especially important role in physical health.","authors":["David J. Yoon","Theresa M. Glomb","Tao Yang","KiYoung Lee","Joyce E. Bono","Michelle K.

Experiencing discrimination can cause stress and negative mental health outcomes. However, Muslim identity can also be a source of coping, and the Muslim community can be a source of support in the face of Islamophobia. We hypothesized that openness about identity within the Muslim community may differ based on gender and that experiences of discrimination would be associated with a desire to hide one’s Muslim identity in public for women but not for men. Seventy-three Muslim college students were recruited through snowball sampling in a cross-sectional survey in North America. Mean differences and correlational patterns were compared between women (n = 35) and men (n = 30). Correlational and regression analyses revealed that for women but not men, discrimination was correlated with hiding one’s Muslim identity in public. Microaggressions and offence at Trump’s proposed travel ban were related to openness with other Muslims for women only. Women were more offended than men by Trump’s statement but only after President Trump took office. Intersectionality needs to be unpacked to better understand the multidimensional nature of gendered Islamophobia and racist policy actions.

The current study examined self-esteem based on the two verbal coercion items included in the latest version of the most popular measure of sexual victimization experience, the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization (SES-SFV; Koss et al., 2007 ). One item includes verbal tactics categorized as “threat” and the other item includes verbal tactics categorized as “criticism.” Undergraduate women ( n = 479) completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the SES-SFV. Results showed that women who experienced criticism reported lower self-esteem than those who did not experience criticism. However, threat experience was not significantly related to women’s self-esteem. Findings support Koss et al.’s suggestion that criticism tactics are more negative than threat tactics, and imply that self-esteem may be negatively associated with some sexually coercive verbal tactics but not associated with others. Future researchers should pay careful attention to operational definitions of verbal coercion.","authors":["Suzanne L. Osman","Halle L.

Therefore, it is important to study what predicts Chinese workers’ attitudes toward strikes. The study applies social exchange theory as an overarching framework to investigate the contributions of three forms of social exchange relations in organizations—employee-employer relations, labor-management relations, and leader-member relations—to account for Chinese employees’ attitudes toward strikes in multinational corporations (MNCs) based in China. Using a matched employee-employer sample of more than 1,600 employees in 41 China-based MNCs, the results obtained from hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis show that individual-perceived employee-employer relations indicated by a negative reciprocity norm is positively related to employees’ strike attitudes. Labor-management relations indicated by the organizational-level cooperative industrial relations (IR) climate is negatively related to employees’ strike attitudes. Leader-member relations indicated by leader-member exchange (LMX) is not significantly related to employees’ strike attitudes.

Recently, Monteiro et al. reported a similar experiment with a single coil but with an ordinary laboratory cart, and had to use the accelerometer of a smart-phone to laboriously extract the precise position of the mag-netic field sensor of the smartphone. The use of the smart cart in this report obviates the need for using the accelerometer and the concomitant laborious extraction of the position data. The eponymous smart cart broadcasts its precise location wirelessly over Bluetooth®.

Here we report that *Ralstonia eutropha* H16 (Cupriavidus necator ATCC 17699) uses l-ascorbate as a sole carbon source via a novel catabolic pathway. RNaseq identified eight candidate catabolic genes, sequence similarity networks, and genome neighborhood networks guided predictions for function of the encoded proteins, and the predictions were confirmed by in vitro assays and in vivo growth phenotypes of gene deletion mutants. l-Ascorbate, a lactone, is oxidized and ring-opened by enzymes in the cytochrome b561 and gluconolactonase families, respectively, to form 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate. A protein predicted to have a WD40-like fold catalyzes an unprecedented benzilic acid rearrangement involving migration of a carboxylate group to form 2-carboxy-l-lyxonolactone; the lactone is hydrolyzed by a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily to yield 2-carboxy-l-lyxonate. A member of the PdxA family of oxidative decarboxylases catalyzes a novel decarboxylation that uses NAD+ catalytically. The product, l-lyxonate, is catabolized to α-ketoglutarate by a previously characterized pathway. The pathway is found in hundreds of bacteria, including the pathogens *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Acinetobacter baumannii*.\\n\\n### Authors\\n- Tyler M. M. Stack, Carl R.

Multimodal signals are hypothesized to be favoured by evolution because they increase the efficacy of detection/discrimination in noisy environments. We tested the hypothesis that female túngara frogs’ responses to attractive male advertisement calls are improved in noise when a visual signal component is added to the available choices. We tested this at two levels of decision complexity (two and three choices). In a two-choice test, the presence of noise did not reduce female preferences for attractive calls. The visual component of a calling male, associated with an unattractive call, also did not reduce preference for attractive calls in the absence of noise. In the presence of noise, however, females were more likely to choose an unattractive call coupled with the visual component. In three-choice tests, the presence of noise alone reduced female responses to attractive calls and this was not strongly affected by the presence or absence of visual components. The responses in these experiments fail to support the multimodal signal efficacy hypothesis. Instead, the data suggest that audio-visual perception and cognitive processing, related to mate choice decisions, are dependent on the complexity of the sensory scene.","authors":["Kimberly L.

This is particularly important for amphibians because many populations are declining and difficult to observe. Attraction of vertebrates to light is a well‐known navigational cue and some fisheries strategies utilize light sources to increase catch success. To optimize population monitoring of state‐endangered eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), we tested the utility of colored glow sticks (green, orange, pink, or yellow) as bait in traps in Maryland and Delaware, USA, during 2015–2016. We then measured intensities of the colored glow sticks and estimated photoreceptive quantum catches of each color according to the spectral sensitivities of eastern tiger salamanders. We found that eastern tiger salamanders' photoreceptors had greater quantum catches of photons from green and yellow glow sticks. However, traps baited with orange glow sticks were more than twice as likely to capture eastern tiger salamanders than were traps baited with green or yellow. There were no differences in the number of salamanders caught per successful trap among glow stick colors, perhaps due to attraction of salamanders to motion from previously captured salamanders. Our results indicate that biases other than perceived intensity of light sources may drive behavioral preferences. © 2020 The Wildlife Society.","authors":["Karen L. Carleton","Eric B.

Recently, it has become more widespread in the U.S. Core elements of Japanese Lesson Study include collaborative lesson design, empirical trials of lessons, collective analysis of empirical trials, and subsequent lesson re-design. We describe how these core elements were implemented in a teacher education project that brought together prospective and practicing secondary-level science and mathematics teachers in interdisciplinary groups facilitated by university faculty members. The four groups described in this report designed and analyzed lessons about attending to scale factor in the context of microscopic images, constructing a geologic timeline, examining states of matter, and building a scale model of the solar system. The Japanese Lesson Study process helped these groups reflect on the nature of the content being taught, pedagogical concerns, and content-specific pedagogy. We found that discursive moves such as connecting separate strands of conversation and identifying mistakes helped facilitate group reflection. A growing body of research suggests that Japanese Lesson Study can be implemented in a wide array of contexts; we encourage others to include it among clinical experiences for prospective teachers because of its potential to give more undergraduates access to the most skilled mentor teachers and to counteract feelings of professional isolation that cause many to leave teaching. We offer our own experiences facilitating lesson study and dealing with challenges along the way to help others start to implement the model in their own professional settings.\\n\\nKeywords: Japanese lesson study, collaboration, reflection, pre-service teachers, professional development\\n\\nAdditional information\\n\\nFunding\\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number DUE-1852139.

In 2012–2014, we conducted point counts at locations previously surveyed in 1981–1983 and analysed Breeding Bird Atlas data from 1980–2013 to estimate long-term population trends of two declining ground-nesting warblers on the Eastern Shore of Maryland within the Atlantic Coastal Plain: the Ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla and the Worm-eating Warbler Helmitheros vermivorum. We detected significant declines for Ovenbirds in both datasets, but we found conflicting data for Worm-eating Warblers. During 2012–2015, we investigated the effects of forest characteristics, such as vegetative composition and ground cover, on occupancy and nest success. Ovenbirds were found more where there were more and larger trees but were negatively affected by the proportion of pines, whereas Worm-eating Warblers were more abundant when there were higher numbers of trees and more pines. Nest success was not affected by vegetation other than the proportion of pine trees or leaf litter depth, both of which increased nest success. Worm-eating Warblers with more pine needles in their nests also had increased nest success. This study presents a nuanced view of how forest composition (proportion of pine trees) of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland influenced ground-nesting warblers differently, and suggests that effectively managing ground-nesting warblers in this area may differ from other regions of Eastern North America due to its unique vegetative composition, structure, and history.","authors":["Ravyn A.

Tropical cyclones constitute major disturbances producing direct effects (damage, mortality) in many coastal communities worldwide. Subsequent reassembly involves changes in composition and abundance for which the underlying mechanisms (deterministic and stochastic processes) are still not clear, especially for mobile organisms. We examined tropical cyclone‐induced changes in composition and reassembly of entire insect communities in 16 Louisiana coastal salt marshes before and after Hurricane Isaac in 2012 and 2013. We used the Shannon index and multivariate permutational ANOVA to study insect resistance and resilience, β diversity partitioning to evaluate the importance of species replacement, and null models to disentangle the relative roles of different assembly processes over time after the tropical cyclone. The α diversity and species composition, overall and for different trophic levels, decreased immediately after the tropical cyclone; nonetheless, both then increased rapidly and returned to pre‐cyclone states within one year. Changes in species abundance, rather than species replacement, was the primary driver, accounting for most temporal dissimilarity among insect communities. Stochastic processes, which drove community composition immediately after the tropical cyclone, decreased in importance over time. Our study indicates that rapid reformation of insect communities involved sequential landscape‐level dynamics. Cyclone‐resistant life cycle stages apparently survived in some, perhaps random locations within the overall salt marsh landscape. Subsequently, stochastic patterns of immigration of mobile life cycle stages resulted in rapid reformation of local communities. Post‐cyclone direct regeneration of salt marsh insect communities resulted from low resistance, coupled with high landscape‐level resilience via re‐immigration. Our study suggests that the extent of direct regeneration of local salt marsh insect communities might change with the size of larger marsh landscapes within which they are imbedded.","authors":["Xuan Chen","William J.

This article identifies the entrepreneurial ecosystem that supported key tech start-ups on the San Francisco Peninsula prior to the 1960s, shows how the ecosystem developed and how it evolved. By 1940, a far-flung ecosystem—from Santa Clara County to San Francisco to Washington, DC – was in place, well before the arrival of the Valley’s first venture capitalists in 1959 and the establishment of the region’s first high-tech law firm in 1961. Federal agencies and laws provided revenue and risk reduction. Local universities provided brainpower. San Francisco-based banks and their Peninsula branches provided financing. San Francisco law firms drafted organizational agreements and protected intellectual property. Without such institutional support, there would be no Silicon Valley as we know it. Silicon Valley’s early high-tech start-ups were supported by an ecosystem that was developed for the agriculture, extractive, and transportation industries. That ecosystem was repurposed for defence-based electronics and telecommunications, and then transformed for the consumer world of calculators, video games and personal computers. The “master cluster” benefitted from being in the right place at the right time, and by inheriting the right ecosystem. KEYWORDS: Silicon Valley, Entrepreneurship, Ecosystem, Clusters, High-tech.

There is a void in our knowledge on the impact of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation on AS in the major elastic arteries. In addition, there is a dearth of findings on the effects of creatine supplementation on SmO2 in the lower leg. Data have indicated that creatine supplementation can result in an increase in lower leg anterior compartment pressure at rest and post exercise. Although the increased pressures seen during these studies were not pathological, this and additional factors associated with creatine supplementation could possibly effect SmO2 during exercise and recovery.\\n\\n## Methods:\\n20 male, physically active participants were randomized in a double‐blind fashion to placebo (PL) (n=10, 22.9±3.1 yrs.) or creatine (CM) (n=10, 21.3±1.8 yrs.) groups. Subjects received 0.3 g/kg/day creatine monohydrate or placebo in gelatin capsules for 7 days. Ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, submaximal exercise tests (10 minute treadmill activity at 3.7 mph and 9% incline), SmO2, and lower leg pain (analog visual scale and pain test algometer) assessments were conducted at baseline and on day 7 of the study period.\\n\\n## Results:\\nThere were baseline differences in central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) (mean difference, 109; 95% confidence interval (CI) 105 to 113, vs. mean difference, 130; 95% CI 114 to 146, p < 0.05) between the PLA and CM groups, respectively. Following the intervention, there were no significant differences between PL and CM in arterial stiffness indices between the groups.

It causes premature loss of lives, the interruption of workforce supply pipelines, increased care demand for injured elderly people, and other socio-economic burdens. This paper presents the importance of and the need for a national comprehensive TBI database that incorporates geospatial data components to help tackle the TBI epidemic. It calls for legislative and research actions to enhance the U.S. TBI data infrastructure to make the use of GIS in TBI research possible. Further, it proposes a multi-tiered conceptual framework and associated implementation strategy to establish the proposed national TBI data structure. The enhanced U.S. TBI data infrastructure will provide a feasible platform to utilize the GIS capabilities for location-based mapping, data analysis and modelling. Precision TBI research, targeted outreach, and education will likely facilitate more effective prevention and better care delivery. The enhanced U.S. TBI database infrastructure will serve as a guiding model for other developing nations. Global concerted efforts on TBI can help improve the overall quality of living around the world.\\n\\n## TBI landscape: prevalence, direct and indirect socio-economic cost\\nBrain injuries present an urgent and severe challenge for modern medicine in general (Katarzyna, Agata, and Marcin Citation2019). Approximately 69 million people sustain a TBI each year globally (Dewan et al. Citation2019). Approximately half of the population is likely to have one or more TBI over a lifetime (Maas et al. Citation2017). There has also been a rapid increase of TBI cases, contributing to it as a worldwide public health problem. According to the WHO (Citation2006), TBI will surpass many diseases as the major cause of death and disability. As less developed nations are engaging and experiencing rapid economic transformation, TBI problems have become not only a pressing public health issue, but also a global epidemic mental health problem and socio-economic burden.\\n\\nIn the U.S, TBI is a leading cause of death and lifelong disability among children and young adults, according to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is a growing ‘silent epidemic’ because the complications from TBI, such as impaired cognition and memory, are often not apparent, and because public awareness about TBI is very limited (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Citation2010). From 2002–2006, approximately 1.74 million people suffered a TBI each year. Fast forward, 2.87 million people in 2014 have sustained TBI annually (Taylor et al. Citation2017), which represents a 67% increase in less than a decade.\\n\\nBeyond the prevalent nature, the healthcare and broader socio-economic cost of TBI has been monumental. From a health perspective, the fundamental hallmark that we humans stand out from the rest of the life forms on earth is our mental capacity. It is impossible to overstate the importance of brain functions in all facets of our daily life. TBI can severely disrupt an individual’s cognitive, social, emotional and physical functioning and cause extensive and prolonged deficits (Tomaszczyk et al. Citation2014; Vitaz et al. Citation2003). Moderate and severe TBI often rob us of parts of that capacity suddenly and prematurely. The impact of TBI is not only the acute bodily impairment and cognitive dysfunctions of the injured person, but also many-fold long-term family and societal impacts. Cognitive, emotional, and functional problems after TBI are often extensive and long lasting (Vitaz et al. Citation2003). The long-term prognosis of severe or recurrent TBI remains poor (Sowers et al. Citation2018). Research from the 1990s reported estimates, the direct acute care cost ranges from 25,174 USD to 81,153 USD per case (McGregor and Pentland Citation1997), and projected post-acute rehabilitation programme annual life care cost (1991 dollars) ranges from 222,600 USD to 450,000 USD (Ashley et al. Citation1997). A recent study on the global macroeconomic burden of road injuries for 166 countries projects 1.8 USD trillion (2010 US$) in 2015–30 (Chen et al. Citation2019).\\n\\nThe prevalence and serious consequences of TBI have imposed a mounting global socio-economic burden, beyond direct medical cost. In past decades, it was estimated that 44% of the world’s road deaths occurred in Asia, and road traffic injuries were on the verge of an epidemic (Hyder et al. Citation2007). The two most populated countries, China and India, have been going through rapid economic growth in recent decades, but there have been no recent data on the TBI care cost. Geospatial analysis tools are rarely used in health policy management in China (Kim, Zhang, and Lee Citation2018). The U.S. and many other developed nations have taken efforts in monitoring and studying the causes and impacts of TBI, while many in non-western developing countries attribute injuries to supernatural causes (Mbakile-Mahlanza, Manderson, and Ponsford Citation2015).\\n\\nTBI alters the workforce supply and productivity, and the resources allocation and consumption of a society. Frequently, TBI affects more kids, youth and elderly people. It is a common cause of death and disability from trauma in children and adolescents in the United States (Rivara et al. Citation2011; Stanley et al. Citation2012; Courtney-Long et al. Citation2015). According to the CDC, in 2014 about 2.87 million TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths occurred in the United States, and over 837,000 cases were related to children.\\n\\nUnderstanding the interwoven relationship between mental, physical, and social health at various levels of analysis is critical to the overall wellbeing of people, societies, and nations (Maier and al'Absi Citation2017; Somers, Rowe, and Clay Citation2009). For example, many TBI patients never recover full social independence (Humphreys et al. Citation2013). One study indicates a 60.4% unemployment rate among those with moderate to severe TBI (Cuthbert et al. Citation2015). Beyond direct costs of TBI care, there are tangible and intangible indirect costs at the individual, family, community and national level. Depression and psychological distress are often associated with TBI (Sigurdardottir et al. Citation2013).\\n\\nFurthermore, TBI represents the quintessential neuropsychiatric combination of effects in cognition, personality, and the risk for psychiatric disorders (Santopietro et al. Citation2015). Naturally, the multitude of cognitive and functional deficits make TBI patients more susceptible to mental problems. Neurological disorders are the most common cause of serious disability (Wong et al. Citation2017), and TBI is a leading cause of disability and mortality (Coronado et al. Citation2011). The estimated prevalence of depression after TBI is over 50% (Moldover, Goldberg, and Prout Citation2004). In 2013, a large study based on the data of 1.13 million cases from 1977–2000 found that individuals with TBI (including concussions) were four times more likely to develop a mental illness, and in particular the head injury between ages 11 and 15 years presented the strongest predictor for subsequent development of schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder (Orlovska et al. Citation2014).\\n\\nConsequently, the TBI epidemic presents a reality that global societies are burdened with the premature loss of lives, the interruption of workforce supply, and increased care demand for injured elderly people, in addition to mounting direct medical cost. In the U.S., according to the CDC, both the young and old are affected the most, which burns the vitality candle of society at both ends.\\n\\nThe burden of healthcare, the potential of human capital, and economic development are intertwined (Chen Citation2018). The hidden cost is beyond calculation. It is urgently important to have an accurate and complete database to better analyse, visualize and understand the where, when, how, and why of the TBI ‘silent epidemic’. GIS is proven to be effective in location-based health data mapping, data integration and analysis.\\n\\nThe prevalence, cost and socio-economic burden of TBI provide reasons for incorporating spatial and temporal data and GIS technology. Consequently, this paper calls for a better TBI database infrastructure by proposing a concept for a U.S. TBI database framework to incorporate geospatial data. The expanded data collection and enhanced database infrastructure will facilitate the use of GIS in mapping out TBI distribution patterns and potential clusters and hotspots, which will lead to more precise and integrated research, targeted education, and more effective prevention.\\n\\n## GIS potential in TBI research\\nGIS can be used in mapping and analysing potential TBI hotspots and associated risk factors, such as natural factors (road construction, topographic slope, speed limit, school safety, sport equipment) and human factors (violence, ageing, drinking and drug abuse, mental health and behaviour management). In fact, GIS has been widely used in other health and epidemiological research. In the past two decades, there has been tremendous development in applying geospatial analyses to health problems (Shi and Kwan Citation2015). GIS and artificial intelligence (AI) offer an immense emerging role for improving community health and healthcare (Shaw Citation2012; Kirby, Delmelle, and Eberth Citation2017; Boulous, Peng, and VoPham Citation2019). TBI research does not only need GIS utilities but also can benefit from its spatial-temporal mapping, data integration and analytical capabilities.\\n\\nFour major reasons for using GIS in TBI studies are briefly outlined below:\\n\\nFirst, in response to rapid growing TBI incidence, much research attention on TBI from both research communities and government agencies has started in recent decades. According to the Traumatic Brain Injury Model System Centres web site (https://www.tbindsc.org/), the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems National Data and Statistical Centre began in 1987 and has its primary purpose and focus on advancing medical rehabilitation. The Traumatic Brain Injury Act was enacted in 1996; subsequent state-level legislative efforts were even later. Currently, research progress has been made on post-injury treatment and rehabilitation care. Yet, globally TBI incidence continues to rise. The growing epidemic presents an urgent need for obtaining a better understanding of spatial and temporal distribution patterns of TBI. Are there any TBI hotspots; and if there are, where are they?\\n\\nSecond, TBI is a trauma to the human brain when humans fail to maintain brain’s normal functions in responding to abrupt environmental changes. The changes can be caused by naturally occurring environmental or human-induced risk factors, or both. Geospatial locations, topography, road and weather conditions, neighbourhood socio-economic characteristics, population density, and employment rates are all important in better understanding the physical and socio-cultural environment settings of TBI incidences. GIS has been effectively used in other health issues for spatial data mapping and analysis, such as surface kriging, spatial clusters, and spatial filtering in dealing with cancer and other health data heterogeneity, risk estimation, and data regression of health risk factors (Meliker et al. Citation2009; Shi Citation2010; Meliker and Sloan Citation2011; Kontopantelis et al. Citation2015; Davies, Jones, and Hazelton Citation2016). Are different TBI clusters and/or hotspots associated with similar risk factors? It is an obvious environmental epidemiology research need to use GIS for TBI studies.\\n\\nThird, according to the CDC, the causes of TBI vary, but the leading mechanism includes unintentional falls, being struck by or against an object, motor vehicle crashes, and violence. In an earlier study (Hyder et al. Citation2007), it was estimated 44% of the world’s road deaths occurred in Asia, and road traffic injuries were on the verge of an epidemic. Where do children and adults fall? What and where are the objects that cause TBI? Are road traffic injuries random or more concentrated at certain locations during certain times? GIS has also emerged as a key tool in predictive crime mapping and policing by many police services to reduce crime (Fitterer, Nelson, and Nathoo Citation2015; Jefferson Citation2017). Based on the leading causes of TBI, environmental settings are very important. Accurate and precise mapping of the environment and demographics associated with TBI incidences should be important and effective. Precision in problem-solving is an obvious argument for adoption of a spatial approach (Goodchild Citation2015).\\n\\nFinally, accurate spatial and temporal information can help facilitate emergency responding as well as potential predictive TBI mapping. At the same time, a better TBI database will improve more targeted research on the association or correlation among the response time from a 911 call to the arrival of emergency medical technicians & paramedics; the travel time from field treatment to receiving hospital emergency care; and the initial recovery time from a 911 call to the time when a patient regains consciousness, for those with moderate and severe TBI cases. Time is essential in the outcome of TBI, and only an accurate and complete database will help shed light on response and treatment time intervals to improve TBI outcomes and survival.\\n\\nThe geographic location, topography, weather, time of occurrence, time of receiving medical attention, and demographic background of TBI patients are all important geospatial parameters. GIS can use georeferenced TBI data to help better delineate and understand the overall the TBI landscape (i.e. distribution patterns and underlying risk factors).\\n\\n## Enhancing the U.S. TBI database infrastructure\\nGIS can and should be effective in facilitating better understanding and targeted TBI research through location-based mapping, data integration, and subsequent data analyses and modelling. However, GIS has not been widely used in TBI research, largely due to the lack of a georeferenced TBI database; the existing U.S. TBI Data Registry does not contain accurate location and time data of TBI incidences.\\n\\nCurrent TBI data collection methods do not require tracking of precise location data and various time intervals from TBI occurrence to treatments. The CDC data are disseminated in the form of only three broad categories: TBI-related Emergency Department Visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths (EDHDs). There have been no comparable or standardized data collection templates reported documenting TBI from first responders to ER visits to hospitalization at any local, state or national level. The geospatial component of each TBI incident is only kept at local emergency dispatcher records or police reports. Therefore, researchers cannot find the spatial distribution patterns of TBI cases at county, city, state and national levels, considering the fact the TBI patients can go to different clinics and hospitals.\\n\\nWe propose to expand the existing U.S. TBI data registry by including geospatial data to allow a broader and more effective implementation of GIS. This endeavour requires legislative support and actions. Specifically, the implementation strategy consists of an integrated and expanded data structure. The implementation process needs to start at the fundamental data collection level and may include developing standardized templates and overall database design enhancement. Geospatial variables may include the incidence time and location, and basic demographics of the TBI patient, such as age, gender, employment status, education, place of residence, and possibly other variables. These parameters make accurate and precise environment-based research and public outreach possible. For example, many important questions can be potentially addressed with the help of GIS:\\n\\n- Are there any geographic hotspots of TBI occurrences?\\n- If certain clusters or hotspots emerge, what could be the possible physical and social environmental risk factors for various clusters?\\n- What are the spatial distribution and reoccurrence patterns of TBI cases at different spatial scales: nationally, regionally and locally?\\n- Is there any correlation between TBI and physical and social environmental risk factors?\\n- What are possible mitigation measures to prevent or reduce TBI in different locations if potential risk factors behind different hotspots are identified?\\n\\nThe proposed is a multi-tiered system. The U.S. TBI data infrastructure for data collection and dissemination promotes an optimal allocation of human and financial resources on TBI care management and precision medical research. Conceptually, it consists of four major tiers (see Figure 1).\\n\\n**Figure 1.** Topology of the proposed U.S. TBI data infrastructure framework.\\n\\nThe first tier is data collection, and it can be done by both emergency first responders and hospital and other care facility staff. The second tier is data compilation and database development, and it is done by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The third tier is a data dissemination portal, which is the CDC, in collaboration with the HHS and possibly other government agencies. The final tier encompasses the back-end data users, including researchers, policy makers, and the general public.\\n\\nIn addition to the conceptual framework, an overall implementation strategy is also important and is outlined in Figure 2. The implementation strategy consists of unified and standardized templates designed for data collection and public access. For data collection, geospatial location could be accurate GPS coordinates (outside of a city limit) or general street address or nearest road intersection of TBI incidents (within city limit). Other geospatial data such as smartphone apps may include environmental factors (weather, topography), employment, contextual social environment setting (home, road, workplace, commercial, school), and general demographic info (age, gender, ethnicity).\\n\\n**Figure 2.** TBI data collection and dissemination templates and data variables.\\n\\nFirst responders and hospitals face different kinds of urgency and have different amounts of time to collect data. Time is critical for TBI patients' survival. The time window from sustaining the injury to receiving medical services often draws a vital line between recovery and disability, or between life and death for some cases. Therefore, medical first responders’ data logging time should be brief, or done retrospectively, primarily recording accurate location data. Accurate geographic locations of TBI incidence can be easily obtained and recorded by emergency medical and law enforcement first responders. Most smart phones can have a good GPS app, where time and coordinates can be easily extracted from an in-situ photo and videos. Police may be able to help log more information about the incident and demographics. Hospitals can add more information as needed.\\n\\nCurrently, the U.S. TBI data are compiled by the HHS. A standard database format across the nation can be established so that the on-site and hospital data can be easily combined into a complete TBI database. This proposed TBI database framework will build upon the currently existing one, preserving the continuity with two minor revisions. To protect patients’ privacy, it would be a good practice to establish a national TBI case digital ID for each patient, instead of using the SSN or driver’s licence ID, to safeguard identifiable personal information. In addition, State ID can be created and incorporated into the database. For example, MD as the text ID or 7 as the numerical ID for Maryland, by the date of admission to the Union. State ID will be useful for quick access and double safeguard of spatial data quality control. Not everyone is familiar with the GPS longitudes in the western hemisphere. State ID will help spot data entry errors.\\n\\nPublic data sharing is done at the CDC. The CDC analysts can double check again to make sure specific private identification information is filtered out (stored in the system, but not accessible by the general public). National data management, preliminary and aggregated analyses can be done as needed for the access of the general public and research community. This way, data will be scalable and accessible at different spatial resolutions and scales, such as county, city, state, and national level.\\n\\n## Discussion and conclusion\\nThe complex web of risk factors in the modern environment and associated dynamic changes have caused and will continue to cause many public health problems. TBI is one of the notably rapid-growing pandemic public health issues due to rapid globalization and increased human mobility. Analyses and visualization of health data with geospatial references can present far more accurate pictures of TBI in the U.S. For example, GIS can be successfully used to map the mobility, mortality and hospitalization rates of TBI cases (Colantonio et al. Citation2011; Hu et al. Citation2013) and significantly improve quality and efficacy in health research (Shaw and McGuire Citation2017). Accurate geospatial data collection and an enhanced TBI database can expand the uses of GIS to help deliver better public education, preventative measures, and TBI healthcare guidelines.\\n\\nLegislative actions to improve the U.S. national TBI database infrastructure and utilization of GIS in TBI research are of far-reaching significance. Comprehensive understanding of TBI facilitates integrated research, effective prevention, better care and broader support for the survivors. Geospatial data components of the TBI database will allow interdisciplinary collaborative research and concerted efforts among healthcare providers, researchers, health informatics and GIS professionals, patients and caregivers in tackling this growing public health problem. TBI is not just a pressing public health issue, it imposes significantly adverse impacts on mental health and socio-economic development. Expanding the existing U.S. TBI data infrastructure is not only necessary, but also significant in guiding other nations. In time, geospatial data and GIS can play a significant role in TBI research and prevention, subsequently, improving the quality of life globally.","authors":["Karl Maier","Donna Ritenour","Mara Chen"],"journal":"Annals of GIS","datePublished":"2020-4-2","aiKeywords":["Legislative and research initiatives to improve data infrastructure","Integration of GIS in health data analysis and mapping","Need for a comprehensive TBI database","Importance of geospatial data in public health research","Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) as a global public health issue","Socio-economic impacts of TBI","Impact of TBI on mental health and societal well-being","Global collaboration in addressing TBI challenges"],"facultyKeywords":["Health sciences, general","Geological and earth sciences nec","Environmental health","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences","Health sciences, other","Health sciences","Health services research","Geosciences, atmospheric, and ocean sciences","Hydrology and water resources science","Medical, biomedical, and health informatics","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Electrical engineering and computer science","Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Mental health, counseling, and therapy services and sciences","Ocean marine sciences and atmospheric science","Geology","Data science and data analytics","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Public health, general","Geophysics and seismology","Atmospheric sciences and meteorology nec","Geology earth science, general","Geochemistry","Geological and earth sciences","Public health","Interdisciplinary computer sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19475683.2020.1744724","licenseUrl":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.09347","type":"paper","title":"Finding molecular targets to reverse nerve degeneration associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)","abstract":"One of the most common comorbidities associated with diabetes mellitus is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which is the progressive degeneration of peripheral nerves. The manner in which DPN develops and the underlying mechanisms of peripheral nerve degeneration are currently unknown. Our lab has characterized a glucose‐induced model of DPN in zebrafish (Danio rerio) in which we observe defasciculation/degeneration of motor axons, decreased myelination, and a decrease in ensheathment by perineurial glia. Currently, we are interested in characterizing the molecular pathways involved in the degeneration we observe. To accomplish this, we are testing dexamethasone, a FDA‐characterized small molecule drug, in an effort to decrease the degree of nerve degeneration present after DPN onset. Beginning 5 days post fertilization (dpf) experimental larvae were immersed in 120 mMd‐glucose for 7 seven days to induce DPN. At 10 dpf, larvae were additionally incubated with 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a 1:1000 dilution of dexamethasone. As a control, a group of larvae were exposed to the same conditions without the addition of the drug treatment.Tg(nkx2.2a:meGFP)fish were used to allow visualization of perineurial glia 12 dpf using EVOS fluorescent microscopy. The percentage of motor axons ensheathed by perineurial glia was measured and quantified using FIJI. An increase in motor axons ensheathed by perineurial glia was apparent, furthermore the number of perineurial cells surrounding the motor axons appeared to increase as well. This increase in perineurial glia is meaningful because these cells form the blood‐nerve‐barrier, have phagocytic capabilities, and have also been shown to provide guidance cues for axonal regrowth. Future work will focus on characterizing the pathways affected by dexamethasone to uncover the molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for facilitating nerve regeneration after DPN onset.\\n\\n## Support or Funding Information:\\nSupport was provided by the Henson School of Science and Technology at Salisbury University.","authors":["Jessica Clark","Gabrielle Elizabeth Voithofer"],"journal":"The FASEB Journal","datePublished":"2020-4-19","aiKeywords":["Nerve Degeneration","Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN)","Zebrafish Model","Therapeutic Interventions","Molecular Pathways"],"facultyKeywords":["Human medical genetics","Health sciences, other","Medical clinical science","Biological and biomedical sciences","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Pharmacology and toxicology","Health sciences, general","Neuroscience","Health sciences","Pharmacology","Health services research","Genetics and genomics","Public health, general","Neurobiology and neurosciences","Public health","Toxicology","Neurobiology and anatomy","Molecular genetics"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.09347","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.08695","type":"paper","title":"Analysis of Published PCR Primers to Determine Sex of Industrial Hemp Seedlings","abstract":"Industrial hemp refers to non‐intoxicating strains ofCannabis sativathat produce high levels of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), the precursor to cannabidiol (CBD). CBD has known health benefits and is being tested for a wide range of potential medicinal uses. When growing hemp for CBD, unfertilized female plants are desired as they produce high amounts of CBDA in their flower organs. Therefore, early identification and elimination of male hemp plants is imperative and allows cultivators to spend fewer resources on plants that won’t produce flower and could possibly pollinate female plants. It has been reported that male cannabis plants can be identified weeks before they show any visual sex features using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), however the results from reported studies have been inconsistent in identifying male plants. Here, genomic DNA from thirteen hemp seedlings was analyzed using male‐DNA‐specific PCR primer pairs described in the research literature. Three different primer pairs (SCAR323, SCAR119, and MADC2) were used in the analyses. SCAR323 primers have been reported to amplify a male‐specific amplicon of 323 base pairs (bp); SCAR119 have been reported to amplify a male‐associated amplicon of 119 bp; and MADC2 primers have been reported to amplify a male‐associated amplicon of 300 bp and a female‐associated amplicon of 450 bp. PCR analyses showed DNA from all 13 of our tested hemp seedlings produced a single SCAR323 amplicon of around 320 bp, suggesting this primer set might not be useful for sex determination. A SCAR119 amplicon of the expected size was seen using DNA from 6 of the 13 seedlings. The DNA from the same 6 plants produced an amplicon of about 400 bp using the MADC2 primers, while DNA from plants that lacked SCAR119 amplicon showed a MADC2 amplicon of about 550 bp. After seven weeks of growth, the hemp plants revealed the presence of male or female reproductive organs. The presence of male pollen sacs correlated with the SCAR119 amplicon and the MADC2 amplicon of 400 bp, indicating these primer sets could be a useful tools for determining plant sex at the seedling stage.","authors":["Allison Nalesnik","Les Erickson"],"journal":"The FASEB Journal","datePublished":"2020-4-19","aiKeywords":["Optimizing cultivation for cannabidiol (CBD) production","Implications of male and female plant characteristics on resource utilization","Use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for early plant sex identification","Identification and sex determination of industrial hemp plants","Genomic analysis of hemp seedlings for practical agricultural applications"],"facultyKeywords":["Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Plant sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Genetics and genomics","Genetics, general","Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology","Agronomy and crop science","Biochemistry","Molecular biology","Molecular genetics","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.08695","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1177/016146812012200404","type":"paper","title":"Seeing through Serpent and Eagle Eyes: Teachers as Handlers of Memories","abstract":"## Background/Context:\\nThis paper is part of the special issue “Reimagining Research and Practice at the Crossroads of Philosophy, Teaching, and Teacher Education.” We propose that there is a vital connection in teaching between curriculum and memories that should be fostered in our classrooms. Because memories are alive and bring meaning to our lives, they need to be handled with care. Unfortunately, however, much of teaching risks to simply embalm what is already dead. We examine how the living work of teachers might reposition curriculum as a body of dynamic memories: a constellation of struggles and belongings, failures and accomplishments. The role of the teacher, in this context, is as a handler of those memories.\\n\\n## Research Design:\\nOur approach derives from sustained interaction as we have sought to bring our scholarly backgrounds in philosophy of education and English teacher education, respectively, into dynamic contact. The methodology of the inquiry is mixed in that it combines teacher narratives (our own) with critical conceptual analysis, collective memory work, and phenomenology. Drawing on a bibliography of texts organized collaboratively by the larger research group, our main authors of reference are Freire, Gramsci, Anzaldua, Style, and Britzman. We also feature several fine-grained narratives that illuminate what we mean by “handlers of memory” in the educational setting.\\n\\n## Conclusions/Recommendations:\\nOur shared philosophizing in this paper is a response to the concern that classroom teaching contributes to the deadening of curriculum as a source of meaning and an avenue for students and teachers to learn about themselves. In response, we propose the image of teachers as handlers of memory who work to cultivate and keep memories alive and central to learning.

Patient-centered care (PCC) using ethnomedicine promises greater patient self-management; however, few studies have examined environmental relationships and PCC in self-management of chronic pain through Ayurveda. Objective: To examine how Ayurveda’s philosophical focus on whole system frameworks describes the integration of the individual and the ecological in tailoring an integrative patient-centered diagnostic and prognostic approach to chronic pain management. Methods: This qualitative case study conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews of Ayurvedic physicians from India (N = 10) and a qualitative inductive content analytic approach. Findings: The diagnostic and interpretational framework of the doshas supports the integration of the individual and the ecological through (a) the circadian and seasonal cycles relating mind-body awareness with diet, lifestyle (e.g., yoga), and breath (e.g., pranayama), and (b) biogeographical and ecosystemic regions relating the biogeographical and the ecological (e.g., desh) with the regulatory principle of pain and its physiological and anatomical perception (vata) in an approach that goes beyond treating pain etiology to a whole person PCC approach. Conclusions: The study highlights how circadian and seasonal cycles and evolutionary spatial-temporal factors of biogeographical and ecological regions are employed in patient assessment and self-management to support patient involvement. Recommendations for PCC in integrative chronic pain management include supporting patient ownership of their care through the dosha framework that relates the individual and the ecological in the patient’s own life-context and supports co-creation of a collaborative plan of care using an ethnomedical framework.","authors":["Vinita Agarwal"],"journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","datePublished":"2020-4-21","aiKeywords":["Ethnomedicine in healthcare","Holistic health approaches","Chronic pain management","Ecological factors in health","Collaborative care planning","Integration of Ayurveda and patient-centered care","Mind-body connection","Patient self-management"],"facultyKeywords":["Biological and biomedical sciences","Health sciences, general","Cell cellular biology and anatomy","Developmental biology and embryology","Nursing science","Epidemiology and biostatistics","Biology biological sciences, general","Environmental health","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences, other","Biomedical sciences, general","Health sciences, other","Pharmacology and toxicology","Neuroscience","Health sciences","Interdisciplinary computer sciences","Health services research","Neurobiology and neurosciences","Oncology and cancer biology","Human medical genetics","Ecology","Nursing specialties and practice","Exercise physiology and kinesiology","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Nursing and nursing science","Medical, biomedical, and health informatics","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Bioinformatics, biostatistics, and computational biology","Mental health, counseling, and therapy services and sciences","Biochemistry and molecular biology","Neurobiology and neurosciences nec","Pharmacology and toxicology nec","Biochemistry","Microbiology and immunology","Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Molecular biology","Physiology, general","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Cell cellular biology and anatomy nec","Genetics and genomics","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Public health, general","Genetics, general","Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology","Bioinformatics, biostatistics, and computational biology nec","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Microbiology, general","Public health","Cell cellular and molecular biology","Ecology and evolutionary biology","Neurobiology and anatomy"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082842","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1200/jco.2020.38.15_suppl.e13587","type":"paper","title":"A retrospective chart review evaluating the relationship between cancer diagnosis and drinking water source on the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland.","abstract":"e13587\\n\\nBackground: The lower Eastern Shore of Maryland is an agricultural and rural region with high cancer rates. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine if cancer patients on the lower Eastern Shore utilize higher rates of well water compared to individuals in the general county population. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all cases of colon, lung, melanoma and breast cancer diagnosed at Peninsula Regional Medical Center in 2017 was completed. Demographic and clinical information including family, smoking and prior cancer history, as well as residential water source were recorded. Individuals with residential addresses outside of Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset counties were excluded. Overall well water use for each county was determined using U.S. 2010 census data. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare well water utilization rates in cancer patients and the overall county population. Results: 631 patient cases were reviewed and 384 patients were identified for data analysis. The majority of patients were white (81%), diagnosed with breast cancer (41%), and used well water (52%, n = 209). Cancer patients in the three counties combined were significantly more likely to use well water than individuals in the general county population (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 2.11, 3.16). In Wicomico county, 61% of cancer patients used well water (n = 140). Wicomico cancer patients were more likely to use well water than individuals in the general Wicomico county population (OR = 4.4, 95% CI 3.41, 5.78). No significant findings were observed for patients living in Worcester and Somerset counties. No differences in family, smoking or prior cancer history in patients using well water versus municipal water were identified. Conclusions: Cancer patients on the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland used well water more than municipal water. Cancer patients also utilized higher rates of well water compared to individuals in the general county population. Interpretation is limited by small sample size and lack of causality, however the results signal a need for additional studies evaluating well water use and cancer risk in this region.","authors":["Veera Holdai","Angela Marie DeRidder","Sowjanya Kalluri"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","datePublished":"2020-5-20","aiKeywords":["Water quality and health","Public health implications","Environmental health","Cancer epidemiology"],"facultyKeywords":["Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Food science and technology","Natural resources and conservation","Health sciences","Public health, general","Environmental science","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences nec","Natural resources conservation and research","Public health","Environmental health","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/jco.2020.38.15_suppl.e13587","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1177/0013161x20925893","type":"paper","title":"Reforming School Discipline: Responses by School District Leadership to Revised State Guidelines for Student Codes of Conduct","abstract":"Purpose: Over the past decade, increasing attention to the negative impacts of exclusionary discipline and disparities therein has led many state educational leaders to enact school discipline reforms. This study examined the response by school district leadership to a state’s revision of guidelines for student codes of conduct. Data: This study leveraged longitudinal data on school district codes of conduct from the 2013–2014 to 2015–2016 school years across the state of Maryland. Codes of conduct were coded in an iterative fashion according to a common set of infraction–response combinations. Research Design: Using a pre–post analytic design, this study examined changes in districts’ codified infractions, responses to infractions, and the overall tier of response. Furthermore, the study compared alignment between state guidelines and district codes of conduct while exploring variation in codified discipline across districts. Findings: Findings suggest that leaders in districts increased the number of response options available for most types of infractions, with the largest increases occurring for more serious infractions. While these increases tended to be driven by increases in the codification of less exclusionary responses, there were nevertheless sizeable increases in the availability of in-school suspension and removal/intervention. In almost all cases, school districts reported distributions of response options that were at a higher tier level than that recommended by the state. Conclusions: Findings are discussed in the context of current efforts to reform school discipline and the implications of such reform for implementation by district and school leadership.","authors":["F.

Methods: We studied PIM inhibition (PIMi) in both hormone-dependent (LNCaP) and -independent (DU145, 22Rv1) prostate cancer cell lines and mouse xenografts. We evaluated PIMi effects via Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and RNAseq of multiple relevant pathways, and performed radiosensitization analysis with colony formation assays. We also investigated xenograft tumor growth with PIMi +/- radiation (RT) or docetaxel. Results: Pretreating the cell lines with PIMi prior to RT caused marked changes in H2AX phosphorylation compared to no PIMi + RT, with most significant alteration in DU145. However, in colony formation assays, 22Rv1 showed greatest radiosensitization with colony survival reduced from 23% to 15% with PIMi. 22Rv1 xenografts were grown in castrated mice, which were randomized to 30 Gy in 15 treatments vs no RT over 3 weeks, -/+ PIMi on RT days. RT + PIMi eliminated gross tumor, compared to an average of 78% and 51% of initial tumor volumes remaining with PIMi alone and RT alone, respectively. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting of harvested tumors showed PIMi altered patterns in proteins involved with hypoxic response (COX-2), cell survival (MDM2), and androgen receptor and suggested interactions between RT and PIMi for both MDM2 and androgen receptor but not COX-2. RNAseq analysis of xenografts showed daily PIMi affected multiple pathways involved in metabolism, growth, and DNA repair. Finally, we tested PIMi -/+ docetaxel in castrated mice with hormone-sensitive (LNCaP) or -resistant (22Rv1) xenografts treated with PIMi -/+ docetaxel. With both xenografts, PIMi + docetaxel reduced tumor size best, with 22Rv1 xenografts most dramatically showing 74% volume reduction from baseline with PIMi + docetaxel compared to 50% and 25% reduction in volumes with PIMi alone and docetaxel alone, respectively. Conclusions: PIMi has multiple pathway effects in prostate cancer. PIMi significantly reduces disease burden, particularly in combination with RT or docetaxel.

Such opportunities can be impactful as either extracurricular or course-embedded experiences. To help readers envision directions for undergraduate research experiences in mathematics education with prospective teachers, we describe a model built on a design-based research paradigm. The model engages pairs of prospective teachers in working with faculty mentors to design instructional sequences and test the extent to which they support children’s learning. Undergraduates learn about the nature of systematic mathematics education research and how careful analyses of classroom data can guide practice. Mentors gain opportunities to pursue their personal research interests while guiding undergraduate pairs.

L. Everts, T. L. Walter, Y. Johnson, A. Ash, L. Thomas, and D. Koval\\n\\nPublished Online: 8 Apr 2020\\n\\nDelaware and Maryland have a long history of commercial production of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) for the processing market. In 2015, we observed lima bean plants that had irregular tan lesions with reddish borders in two fields in Sussex County, DE. Lesions ranged from 0.4 to 2.0 cm in diameter. Approximately 10% of leaves were symptomatic, and severity ranged between 5 and 10%. Symptomatic leaves (n = 6 to 10) were collected in September and October from each field for isolation and evaluation. Similar symptoms were observed on lima bean plants at the University of Maryland Lower Eastern Shore Research and Education Center in 2018, and additional symptomatic leaves (n = 6) were collected. Isolations were conducted from six diseased leaves per field (n = 18) by placing 2- to 4-mm sections of leaf on potato dextrose agar (PDA). All lesions resulted in isolates that appeared similar in morphology. Hyphae from the representative colonies were placed on water agar, and after 24 h, hyphal tips were excised. The hyphal tip procedure was repeated once to obtain pure cultures. Six isolates from Delaware and one from Maryland were stored at –80°C until use. Morphological evaluation of isolates grown on oat agar (OA), malt extract agar (MEA), and PDA revealed conidial morphology and dimensions consistent with previously published reports of Didymella americana (Aveskamp et al. 2010; Gorny et al. 2016). Two isolates, De15-002 and Md18-06, were selected for molecular analysis. DNA was extracted from colonies grown on OA; the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4, and the partial actin locus region was amplified with primers act-512/act-783. Basic local alignment searches compared sequences to the ITS (GenBank accession no. FJ426972) and partial actin (FJ426870) sequences of D. americana reference strain CBS 185.85 (Chen et al. 2017; Gorny et al. 2016). The ITS sequences of isolates De15-002 and Md18-06 (MN698269 and MN944417, respectively) shared a 100% similarity with the reference strain. The partial actin sequences of isolates De15-002 (MN820723) and Md18-06 (MN820722) were also identical and differed from the reference sequence by 1 bp (99% similarity). To fulfill Koch’s postulates, four 3-week-old lima bean plants (cv. C-Elite) were sprayed with a conidial suspension (3 × 105 conidia/ml) from 30-day-old cultures grown on MEA or with distilled water (control). Following 28 days of incubation at approximately 20°C, lesions were observed on all plants that were inoculated with isolates De15-001, De15-002, De15-004, De15-005, De15-007, De15-009, and Md18-06, but not on the water-inoculated control plants. Reisolations (n = 4 per isolate) onto water agar and MEA were examined after 7 days to confirm morphology similar to the original isolates. Based on the morphological and molecular characteristics, the pathogen was identified as D. americana. This is the first report of D. americana on lima bean in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Lima bean is the most widely grown vegetable crop in Delaware, and in 2018, the state led production nationally. A new disease on the crop is important to the agricultural economy of Delaware, and the yield loss potential of this pathogen needs assessment in the region. This species has only been reported in 2016 on lima bean, in New York (Gorny et al. 2016). The author(s) declare no conflict of interest.","authors":["L. Thomas","Y. Johnson","K. L. Everts","T. L.

Injuries included a flaccid right arm and hand, laceration of his right thigh, and a fracture of the 3rd metatarsal of his right foot. Patient’s chief complaint was pain in right shoulder and neck and an inability to complete ADLs.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient demonstrated flaccid right upper extremity with very little finger movement. Patient was able to achieve some finger flexion of all 5 digits and thumb opposition to index finger, although could not achieve pad to pad contact. All PROM of joints was preserved. Sensation was grossly intact. Patient tolerated initial examination well with mild discomfort during objective measures. No red flags arose during medical screening/systems review.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:\\n1. Cerebrovascular accident\\n2. Brachial plexus stretch injury\\n3. Brachial plexus avulsion injury\\nTESTS AND RESULTS: MRI of cervical spine without contrast – small disc herniation, MRI of brachial plexus with and without contrast - edema involving right scalene and adjacent fascial planes extending into brachial plexus as well as into right C6/C7 and C7/T1 neural foramen to confirm nerve root sleeve tears, CTA of neck – negative for artery involvement, EMG study showed that the brachial plexus was not avulsed, but not currently sending EMG signals to hand.\\nFINAL/WORKING DIAGNOSIS: Brachial plexus stretch injury\\nTREATMENT AND OUTCOMES:\\n1. Therapeutic exercises (ROM, strength, endurance, stability),\\n2. Therapeutic activity (work specific, ADL specific),\\n3. Neuromuscular rehabilitation (muscle re-education, sequencing, coordination, neurodynamics),\\n4. Patient education (home exercise program, home safety). Patient has been responding well to a treatment plan combining aspects of the above mentioned interventions. Has been showing greater activation of right hand and forearm muscles with ability to complete weak grip at this stage. Right upper extremity remains supported in sling.","authors":["Brent F.

In her introduction to The Routledge Companion to Dramaturgy, Magda Romanska reminds us that the original Greek compound word – dramatourgos – can mean “play maker,” but also “play composer,” as the root word “drama” comes from the Attic verb for “action,” and “tourgos” from the verb for “working together,” which literally translates as “work,” or, significantly, “composition.” Thus, writes Romanska, “originally, dramatourgos meant someone who was able to arrange various dramatic actions in a meaningful and comprehensive order” (1).\\n2.

I was trained in Viewpoints and Composition by Maria Porter, Professor of Theatre at the Long Island University-Post. Porter’s training in these techniques began when she was one of Anne Bogart’s students at the University of California. Her work was later influenced by further training at Eugenio Barba’s Odin Teatret in Holstebro, Denmark, where she met Argentinian director Cristina Castrillo; they have worked together extensively over the last twenty-plus years at Teatro delle Radici in Lugano, Switzerland. Porter has said that the techniques I was taught are the manifestation of a marriage of disciplines (Bogart, Odin, Castrillo) within Porter’s personal aesthetic. Thus, my practice is yet another permutation of the form, owing to my experiences with Porter, my separate study of Bogart’s methods, and my own discoveries over the past seventeen years.\\n18.

We expand our analysis to consider gender as a moderator of the job insecurity–sleep quality relationship, predicting the relationship will be stronger for men than for women. Study 1 uses a nationally representative sample from the Midlife Development in the United States National Survey Refresher study consisting of 1031 working adults and a multi‐group path analysis to test our hypotheses.

Undergraduates (n = 531; 385 female) completed the Rape-Victim and Rape-Perpetrator Empathy Scales (Smith and Frieze 2003) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization and Perpetration (Koss et al. 2007). Participants were categorized into four sexual aggression experience groups, which included \\"nonexperienced\\" (n = 220; 129 female), \\"victimization-only\\" (n = 206; 185 female), \\"perpetration-only\\" (n = 8; 2 female), and \\"overlapping\\" (both victimization and perpetration experience, n = 42; 25 female). The majority of those with perpetration experience also reported victimization experience (overlapping experience; 84%), and the perpetration-only group was too small to test. Those with victimization-only experience reported greater empathy with a rape victim than those with overlapping experience and those nonexperienced, but the latter two groups did not differ. No differences were found among these three groups for empathy with a rapist. Women reported greater empathy with a rape victim, and lesser empathy with a rapist, than men. Those nonexperienced and with overlapping experience may not be able to take the perspective of and empathize with a rape victim to the same extent as those with victimization-only experience, perhaps due to less similarity in experience. Future researchers should consider those with overlapping sexual aggression experience as distinct from those with victimization-only or perpetration-only experience.  \\n---  \\n**References**  \\n1.

While the ownership of the mall owns many of these stores and directly hires service employees to sell products across the stores, it also rents out or sells some of the stores to individual owners. These store owners have separate product suppliers from the ownership of the mall and autonomously decide what they want to sell and how they conduct their business. Due to the small size of these stores, the individual store owners often do not hire service employees; instead, they themselves play the role of service employees. Since they are independent entities within the mall, corporate management of the mall does not collect performance data of these tenants/owners.\\n2 We replicated these findings without including the control variables in the analyses.","authors":["David J.

By analysing relationships between level of education and components of the World Risk Index, this study demonstrated an education’s role in natural hazard awareness and mitigation. For this purpose, we analysed relationships between the components of WRI, created an education factor independent of WRI (based on PISA 2018 Science test results), analysed the frequency, magnitude and exposure of natural hazards of an extreme event character in selected countries and analysed the relationships between the education factor and WRI components among the countries. A detailed analysis was performed for 15 countries representing the full global range of natural hazards (frequency, magnitude and exposure to droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods (not related to hurricanes), mass movements, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis) and level of education. We found that the education factor (ranked and normalised to the maximal value among the considered countries) has significant negative correlation with the following WRI parameters: the Natural Hazard Factor (relative vulnerability, based on the difference between the relative and calculated WRI, ranked and normalised to the maximal value of WRI differences), susceptibility, lack of coping capacities and lack of adaptive capacities (all ranked and normalised to the maximal value). Results indicated that countries at low risk tend to be over-aware while countries at high risk are under-aware of natural hazards. Education can significantly increase awareness of natural hazards and reduce their impact.","authors":["Raivo Aunap","David Cerulli","Michael Scott","Ain Kull","Ülo Mander","Jack Holbrook","Jaan Pärn"],"journal":"Sustainability","datePublished":"2020-9-16","aiKeywords":["Vulnerability and susceptibility to natural disasters","Natural hazard awareness","Mitigation strategies for natural disasters","Impact of education on disaster risk reduction","Correlation between education and World Risk Index components"],"facultyKeywords":["Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Climatology, atmospheric chemistry and physics","Geosciences, atmospheric, and ocean sciences","Natural resources and conservation","Hydrology and water resources science","Geological and earth sciences","Education research nec","Atmospheric sciences and meteorology, general","Environmental science","Ocean marine sciences and atmospheric science","Education, general","Geology earth science, general","Natural resources conservation and research","Education, other","Education","Education research"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187623","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1187/cbe.20-04-0062","type":"paper","title":"Fourteen Recommendations to Create a More Inclusive Environment for LGBTQ+ Individuals in Academic Biology","abstract":"This essay highlights recommendations to make academic biology more inclusive of LGBTQ+ individuals.

Ubiquitination involves the attachment of the small polypeptide ubiquitin to target proteins to control their activity or stability. As a reversible modification, E3 ubiquitin-ligases attach ubiquitin to proteins while deubiquitinases (DUBs) remove ubiquitin from tagged proteins. Revealing the mechanisms that regulate ubiquitination/deubiquitination is important for understanding how cells fine-tune protein activity to control important processes and pathways. It is clear in animals and yeast that WD-repeat proteins (WDR) bind to and activate DUBs. In plants, however, no interactions between WDR proteins and DUBs have been reported. Here, we used BLAST searches to identify plant homolog proteins of a conserved animal DUB and its associated WDR proteins. Based on these homologies, we predicted that Arabidopsis UBP3, a DUB involved in pollen development and transmission, forms a complex with the WDR proteins At2g37160 and LRS1. Indeed, these three proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated when transiently co-expressed as epitope-tagged proteins in plant cells. At2g37160 also interacted with UBP3 in the yeast two-hybrid system and could enhance the DUB activity of UBP3 ten-fold in vitro. These results provide the first evidence that plant DUBs, like animal DUBs, are regulated by WDR proteins.","authors":["Glenda Gillaspy","Janet Donahue","Floyd Lester Erickson","Andrew Baskerville"],"journal":"BIOS","datePublished":"2020-10-8","aiKeywords":["Comparative analysis of protein regulation between plants and animals","Role of WD-repeat proteins in cellular processes","Ubiquitination and deubiquitination mechanisms","Protein interaction and regulation in plants"],"facultyKeywords":["Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Plant sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Cell cellular biology and anatomy","Genetics and genomics","Biochemistry and molecular biology","Developmental biology and embryology","Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology","Genetics, general","Biochemistry","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences nec","Cell cellular and molecular biology","Molecular biology","Molecular genetics","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1893/bios-d-18-00029","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1080/07393148.2020.1860560","type":"paper","title":"Introduction: Beyond Citizenship and the Nation-State","abstract":"The Call for Papers for this Special Issue of New Political Science “Beyond Citizenship and the Nation-State” was written in what now seems an utterly different time: Fall 2019. This Special Issue acts as a bookend to “Intersectionality for the Global Age,” the December 2015 Special Issue co-edited by Jocelyn M. Boryczka and Jennifer Leigh Disney. “Intersectionality in the Twenty-first Century,” Boryczka and Disney wrote in their Introduction to that issue, “seems to provide an analytic method and epistemological perspective that resonates with our attempts, as scholars and everyday people, to understand the rapidly changing and increasingly complex contemporary world.” That Special Issue reflected their focus as co-editors from 2014–2017 on bringing intersectional scholarship from across the globe more centrally into the journal’s scope. Building a stronger international presence for the journal in terms of contributors, reviewers, and audience remained a commitment of the editorial team led by Jocelyn M. Boryczka (2014–2020), Jennifer Leigh Disney (2014–2017), and Sarah M. Surak (interim co-editor 2019–2020) over a six-year trajectory. Intersectionality as a methodology and epistemology now extends well beyond the discipline of political science and academia and into mainstream political discourse. For instance, signs produced by the National Organization for Women (NOW) stating “Intersectional Feminism” appeared at the annual Women’s March Global protests from 2017–2020. Intersectionality also travels well beyond the borders of the United States to operate on a more global scale, providing a powerful tool for critically analyzing what “citizenship” and “nation-state,” the cornerstone concepts in this current Special Issue, mean in the twenty-first century. “This is my home/this thin edge of barbwire,” Gloria Anzaldúa, a founding feminist political theorist of intersectionality, writes, “the U.S.-Mexican border es una herida abierta where the Third World grates against the first and bleeds.” This border acts as a touchpoint for this 2020 Special Issue as one way to examine the push for boundaries defining nation-states and who belongs in them and the pull away from citizenship as unable, given its conceptual grounding in the modern period, to account for what membership in a political community actually means in a globalized world. The driving question for this Special Issue then is, what does citizenship mean in this age of securitization and globalization as the nation-state appears simultaneously to decline and ascend? Little did we know when conceiving this question in Fall 2019 the extent to which the events of 2020 would shape our thinking around such questions or the production of this Special Issue. The outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, China, right on the precipice of 2020. Rapidly, the virus spread across China and Europe, arriving in the United States in February 2020 with stay-in-place orders going into place quickly thereafter in the Northeast. Hospitals filled. The elderly in nursing homes suffered and died. Grocery stores became the only place to go beyond your primary residence. Universities and colleges quickly went to remote learning. Homeschooling went from a more marginal practice to the primary way young people learned as parents and guardians became full-time teachers. To date, 217 countries and territories report about 64.2 million cases and 1.5 million deaths, with the United States as the world leader in both categories. Amid a global pandemic, nation-states pulled inwards, closing borders between countries and often preventing travel within them. Citizens pulled even further inwards into their homes and onto computer screens. Social gatherings of any size disappeared for most as isolationism took on new meaning and intensity. This Special Issue is wholly a pandemic issue. While the articles do not focus on COVID-19, the first round of papers were due March 15, 2020, as lockdowns, shutdowns, and border closings spread quickly. Working with authors during this time, in particular, humanized the editorial process. We learned about the families, work constraints, and general wellbeing of our authors, engaging, as we all were, in a chaotic, stressful, and taxing time. We all felt the pressure of timelines, delays, and at points, the inability to think creatively as the world around us changed rapidly. As we draw the narrative arch of these articles, we cannot neglect the overlying situation of the world around us. This is not the way we anticipated culminating our time with the journal, but seldom is reality that of our making. Migration, a central focus of this Special Issue, has currently paused as borders close and states restrict travel to stem the spread of COVID-19. It will likely resume, perhaps in new ways, in the wake of mass vaccine distribution in 2021. Physical migration is a pattern of life shared by many across the world and a feature of human life accelerated by globalization. Virtual migration is a newer feature of contemporary human life, one intensified during the pandemic as Zoom became a verb common to everyday conversation. This Special Issue’s authors take us across the globe from Turkey and Sri Lanka to Canada to engage with variations of migration as the entry point to inviting us to imagine a world no longer defined by citizenship as a vestige of the modern nation-state. The Special Issue begins with work of David Watkins, who engages with citizenship through the lens of political theorists of immigration who either critique or defend restrictive policies in ways that overlook concrete identities and insights from a critique of methodological nationalism. In “Identity and the Demand for Inclusion: The Critique of Methodological Nationalism and the Political Theory of Immigration,” Watkins lifts up the importance of theorizing immigration with a fuller conception of how identity and its processes shape the subjectivity of immigrants. The nation-state’s role in forming this subjectivity is of particular significance as moving across borders, where the full force of the state is on display, impacts immigrant identities in ways that differ from others while informative to understanding that of us all. Watkins does so through a critique of methodological nationalism, which “treats a normative justificatory vision of how nation-states should work as if it were a description of how they do work.” Watkins argues “that greater attention to concrete identities and identity formation processes, divorced from the assumptions and biases of methodological nationalism can actually erode, rather than bolster, the case for restrictivist immigration policies.” This article contributes to conceptualizing the identity formation of all citizens in terms of border crossings as opposed to ossified locations within the geographic and imaginary boundaries of nation-states. Rachel Yacaaʔał George and Sarah Marie Wiebe provide an alternative understanding of citizenship centered within the relationship of humans and the natural environment. “Fluid Decolonial Futures: Water as a Life, Ocean Citizenship and Seascape Relationality” challenges the reader to shift understandings of a state-based identity to one framed by the source of all life: water. Unlike our drawing of fixed boundaries in the modern nation-state system, this alternative is a fluid understanding of seascapes as spaces that open and produce and reproduce rather than stable, hardened borders. The rhythm of their piece mimics the ever-present motion of waves hitting a shoreline and enacts a form of “voyaging methodology.” Weaving together vignettes of practice, this article engages a range of alternate methodologies, including interpretive methods, political ethnography, Indigenous storytelling, and community engagement research rooted in theoretical perspectives that challenge Western, anthropocentric settler-colonial narratives. Through this praxis, illustrated with photographs taken along their physical journeys, the authors open a space to allow the reader to imagine another type of world that is yet rooted in current arrangements. Water itself, required for life, is ever-present throughout the article, centers this space and rejects the human delineated boundaries of the territory of a nation-state. Instead, water brings together people and can be a space for community-engaged research that imagines and calls forward decolonized futures. While we imagine land borders, in ways signaled by Watkins’ article, as we consider the modern expression of the nation-state, Shelby Ward uses the ocean narrative from a geopolitical framing to describe how water as a defining feature of how once colonized island states produce and reproduce national identities both historically and contemporarily. In “The Postcolonial State as Container: Lessons on Nation-Building and the Nation-State from Sri Lanka,” Ward examines the discursive production and reproduction of the “idea” of post-colonial Sri Lanka as an island state through explicit and hidden forms of overt and discursive violence. Ward describes how the historical mapping and social imaginary constructions of colonial islands as sites of pleasure and adventure are reproduced today within the tourism industry. Given the history of violent political struggle and deadly natural disasters, this reproduction is possible only when recasting the narrative by reproducing the colonial imaginary of islands as exotic “treasure boxes” containing “exotic,” historically “Oriental” experiences and artifacts for Western appropriation and enjoyment. Ward then shifts to describe how to also read the history of Sri Lanka as a “caged-problem,” a colonial sign from international relations which also draws upon this inside/outside narrative rooted in the European display of the colonial (human) zoo. This hierarchy is reproduced in post-colonization politics of inside/outside through the interstate relations, as is illustrated by the example of the civil war and external sovereign relationships illustrated by the international response to the 2004 tsunami. Ward’s reading brings together the intersections of travel, war, human rights, and disaster relief by describing both the production and reproduction of the nation-state as a one of reproducing discourses of the island-state as “treasure box” as well as embodying the “caged-problem,” both rooted in colonial domination and international economic relations. The full force of securitization as exercised along nation-state borders emerges in Reha Atakan Cetin’s article “Externalization of the European Union Migration Regime: The Case of Turkey.” Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees in the world, the majority of whom fled from Syria, generally practicing an open-door policy. As a candidate for membership in the European Union (EU), however, Turkey increasingly aligns its migration policies with the EU’s securitized management practices designed to prevent migrants from crossing its borders. “This study,” as Cetin states, “focuses on the ways in which the externalization of the EU migration regime securitizes Turkish immigration policy. It argues that the EU further securitizes Turkey’s already securitarian migration regime by employing the principle of conditionality,” in this case, membership in the EU. This historical case analysis locates the refugee or migrant within the broader dynamics of international politics where nation-states negotiate their relationships and determine who garners inclusion in such unions. The final two articles describe attempts to confront and leverage migration and citizenship through political actions and engagements. The first describes how migrants have challenged and integrated the state’s neoliberal requirements by infusing their own methods of practice to secure citizenship rights. The second engages those who are already within borders, focusing not on legal status but democratic community participation. In “Family Reunification as an Earned Right: A Framing Analysis of Migrant Workers’ Pathways to Neoliberal Multicultural Citizenship in Canada,” Rupaleem Bhuyan, Kate Yoon, and Lorraine Valmadrid analyze the discourse of migration and neoliberal citizenship in Canada. Canada is unique in that it allows the application for permanent residence for migrant careworkers and their families after only two years of work. While this appears to be quite liberal in terms of immigration policy, and the government in recent years has touted a “welcome immigrants” platform while creating language, status, and education barriers for those migrating in seeking permanent residence. Using a feminist, participatory action research methodological approach, the authors interpret the experiences of migrant caregivers who challenge requirements for permanent residency and family reunification based on exclusionary neoliberal, multicultural discourses. Through their framing analysis of policy documents and political rhetoric, as well as interview research, they find that caregivers simultaneously define themselves as neoliberal actors to leverage their “value” within the Canadian migration system while at the same time continuing to engage traditional ethics utang na loób, a form of reciprocal obligation to define for themselves their relationship with the state. In doing so, careworkers have leveraged their employment position to serve as an anchoring point for family immigration by leveraging the neoliberal discourse of self-sufficiency. In “Race, Citizenship, and Participation: Interrogating the Racial Dynamics of Participatory Budgeting,” Laura Pin assesses how municipal-level participatory budgeting practices in Chicago (United States) intersect with race and citizenship, allowing limited spaces for non-citizen participation with the potential for more substantial community engagement. Building upon the work of many of the scholars appearing in New Political Science’s symposium on this topic in 2017, she uses rich, in-depth interviews and participant observations to understand the impact of participatory budgeting, which is assumed to increase minority participation that actually leverages engagement within diverse communities. While participatory budgeting does increase participation by Black and Hispanic residents, Pin’s interviews show that this participation is surface level rather than a deep form of engagement proposed within deliberative democratic theory. With a specific focus on citizenship, Pin also explores how in Chicago’s model, unlike many others in the United States, participation is both allowed and encouraged by non-citizen community residents regardless of legal status. Her research shows that undocumented residents face explicit and implicit barriers to participation despite defining and specifically opening participation to anyone living in the community. Pin concludes that while participatory budgeting does increase community engagement, as currently practiced it does not challenge or transform existing structural inequalities. For Pin, this is not an inherent constraint within participatory budgeting. In a very timely conclusion, she identifies how we see alternative forms of participatory budgeting with calls to defund the police by community members. For Pin, these, perhaps, hold a far better chance of “recovering the radical core of the process and extending political inclusion.” From theory to practice, this Special Issue calls forward the critical dimension of how identity forms the subjectivity of peoples globally when reimagining citizenship and the nation-state in the Global Age. Attention to the dynamics of race, class, gender, sex, sexuality, and the entire range of ascriptive identity variables humanizes the often dehumanizing processes of globalization when peoples crossing borders become numbers categorized to determine entry. COVID-19, of course, knows no nation-state borders or categories of peoples, though its impact has been most devastating for Black and brown peoples across the globe. As the global pandemic spread in 2020 so did a resurgent movement to address another ongoing, historic pandemic – that of racism. The September 2020 issue of this journal included a collection of essays and “New Political Science and Black Lives Matter Statement” reflecting on the confluence of these two pandemics – racism and COVID-19. The articles in this Special Issue, in conjunction with the September 2020 issue, capture the impulse of progressive scholarship required of this current moment as we engage in theoria “to see” a way toward a better, more sustainable, just future.","authors":["Jocelyn M.

We quantified this variation by analyzing natural soundscapes with the mid-frequency cover index and by measuring the frequency ranges and call rates of the most common acoustically communicating species. We then tested female mate choice in the túngara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) in varying types of background chorus noise. We broadcast two natural túngara frog calls as a stimulus and altered the densities (duty cycles) of natural calls from conspecifics and heterospecifics to form the different types of chorus noise. During both conspecific and heterospecific chorus noise treatments, females demonstrated similar preferences for advertisement calls at low and mid noise densities but failed to express a preference in the presence of high noise density. Our data also suggest that nights with high densities of chorus noise from conspecifics and heterospecifics are common in some breeding ponds, and on nights with high noise density, the soundscape plays an important role diminishing the accuracy of female decision-making.","authors":["Ryan C Taylor","Derek A Coss","Kimberly L Hunter"],"journal":"Behavioral Ecology","datePublished":"2020-11-10","aiKeywords":["Acoustic communication in animals","Female mate selection under varying noise conditions","Interference of noise in animal communication","Impact of environmental sound on mate choice","Influence of natural soundscapes on animal behavior"],"facultyKeywords":["Cognitive neuroscience","Ecology","Geosciences, atmospheric, and ocean sciences","Ecology and evolutionary biology","Biological and biomedical sciences","Neuroscience","Atmospheric sciences and meteorology, general","Ocean marine sciences and atmospheric science","Neurobiology and neurosciences","Marine biology and biological oceanography","Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Evolutionary biology","Neurobiology and anatomy"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/araa091","licenseUrl":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model"},{"id":"10.1080/00150517.2020.12427576","type":"paper","title":"Generalized Fibonacci Sequences in Pythagorean Triple Preserving Matrices","abstract":"In this paper, we explore new connections between Pythagorean triples and generalized Fibonacci sequences.

The lower Eastern shore of Maryland is a rural, agricultural region with some of the highest rates of cancer in Maryland and the United States. Our study sought to characterize residential private well water use among cancer patients on the lower Eastern shore of Maryland, and to compare private well water utilization between cancer patients and the general regional population. Retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients diagnosed with colon, lung, melanoma or breast cancer at a regional hospital from 1 January 2017 through 31 December 2018. Residential water source was determined using residential address and municipal water records. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare residential private well water utilization between our study population and the baseline regional population. The majority of cancer patients (57%) lived in homes supplied by private well water (428/746). Cancer patients were more likely to live in homes supplied by private well water compared to individuals in the general regional population (57% vs. 32%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, cancer patients on the lower Eastern shore of Maryland were more likely to live in homes supplied by residential private well water than the regional population.

Here, laboratory experiments were conducted to study the particle‐covering behavior ofS. invictain response to viscose surfaces or surfaces treated with essential balm or liquid paraffin in the presence of real food (sausage) or non‐food objects (acrylic plates).S. invictaworkers deposited significantly more soil particles on these three types of treated surfaces than on untreated surfaces. In addition, significantly more particles were relocated on viscose and paraffin‐smeared surfaces in the presence of food than in the presence of non‐food objects. The particle‐covering behavior on viscose surfaces was also observed in the field. Interestingly, when no soil particles were available, ants searched and transported food on viscose surfaces only if the surfaces were artificially covered with sufficient quantities of soil particles but could not do so on viscose surfaces without soil particles or with insufficient quantities of soil particles. In addition, ants actively relocated particles to cover viscose surfaces if the transportation distance was within 200 mm, whereas significantly fewer particles were relocated at longer transportation distances (400 mm). Our study provides a novel example of particle use by fire ants during foraging.","authors":["Chao Wen","Xuan Chen","Jian Chen","Wen‐Quan Qin","Jun‐Bao Wen","Xiu‐Jun Wen","Cai Wang","Jia‐Cheng Cai"],"journal":"Insect Science","datePublished":"2020-12-29","aiKeywords":["Ecological adaptations","Particle-use behaviors","Foraging behavior","Eusocial insects","Food search and transportation"],"facultyKeywords":["Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Entomology","Ecology","Biological and biomedical sciences","Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Animal sciences","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences nec","Microbiology and immunology","Biology biological sciences, general","Microbiology, general","Ecology and evolutionary biology","Biological and biomedical sciences, other","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.12891","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1002/term.3164","type":"paper","title":"Cerebrospinal fluid replacement solutions promote neuroglia migratory behaviors and spinal explant outgrowth in microfluidic culture","abstract":"Disorders of the nervous system (NS) impact millions of adults, worldwide, as a consequence of traumatic injury, genetic illness, or chronic health conditions. Contemporary studies have begun to incorporate neuroglia into emerging NS therapies to harness the regenerative potential of glial-mediated synapses in the brain and spinal cord. However, the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds neuroglia and interfaces with their associated synapses remains only partially explored. The flow of CSF within subarachnoid spaces (SAS) circulates essential polypeptides, metabolites, and growth factors that directly impact neural response and recovery via signaling with healthy glia. Despite the availability of artificial CSF solutions used in neurosurgery and NS treatments, tissue engineering projects continue to use cell culture media, such as Neurobasal (NB) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), for development and characterization of many transplantable cells, matrixes, and integrated cellular systems. The current study examined in vitro behaviors of glial Schwann cells (ShC) and spinal cord explants (SCE) within a CSF replacement solution, Elliott's B Solution (EBS), used widely in the treatment of NS disorders. Our tests used EBS to create defined chemical microenvironments of extracellular factors within a glial line (gLL) microfluidic device, previously described by our group. The gLL is comparable in scale to the in vivo SAS that envelopes endogenous CSF and enables molecular transport via mechanisms of convective diffusion. Our results illustrate that EBS solutions facilitate ShC survival, morphology, and proliferation similar to those measured in traditional DMEM, and additionally support glial chemotactic behaviors in response to brain-derived growth factor (BDNF). Our data indicates that ShC undergo significant chemotaxis toward high and low concentration gradients of BDNF with statistical differences between gradients formed within diluents of EBS and DMEM solutions. Moreover, SCE cultured with EBS solutions facilitated measurement of neurite explant extension commensurate with reported in vivo measurements. This data highlights the translational significance and advantages of incorporating CSF replacement fluids to interrogate cellular behaviors and advance regenerative NS therapies.","authors":["Brian Ayers","Maribel Vazquez","Alyssa Brady","Bonnie L.

The intent of this study is to identify the role various factors play in the development of secondary trauma (also known as compassion fatigue). A simple random sample of National Association of Social Workers members were asked to participate. Participants completed an online survey that explored their exposure and responses to secondary traumatic stress. The online survey consisted of standardized measures including the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale and The Coping Strategies Inventory which assesses secondary trauma and self-care strategies, respectively (Bober, Regehr, & Zhou, 2006; Bride, Robinson, Yegidis, & Figley, 2003). The magnitude of work (the extent and intensity of time working with trauma-exposed clients) is assessed by a non-standardized measure which consists of clinical caseloads composition questions. Job satisfaction is measured by items taken from the National Association of Social Workers’ workplace questionnaire (Whitaker & Arrington, 2008). 161 social workers completed the online survey. It required approximately 35 minutes to complete. This project empirically demonstrated that high-magnitude social work practice (providing therapeutic intervention to trauma survivors, i.e. military service members and veterans) is associated with higher levels of secondary trauma. There is also empirical evidence that self-care strategies can mitigate the impact of the secondary trauma.

The Grade 6 standards are particularly ambitious in the goals they set. In this critique, experiences helping children work toward the Grade 6 Common Core statistics expectations are used in conjunction with previous research to identify ways in which the Grades 4–6 standards might be supplemented or revised to help maximize learning. It is suggested that opportunities for children to perceive datasets as aggregates and to draw reasonable conclusions about statistical data by attending to context should be purposefully introduced in Grades 4–5. Currently, the Common Core does not have explicit learning standards for these activities in fourth and fifth grade. It is also suggested that teachers help students question their natural tendencies to focus extensively on the mode when summarizing data. The current standards do not specifically mention the mode. Revising or supplementing the Common Core in the suggested ways holds potential to make the Grade 6 statistical learning standards more attainable for children and to help teachers better anticipate the statistical thinking tendencies that are likely to emerge during classroom discourse.\\n\\n**KEYWORDS:** Aggregate, Context, Design-based research, Learning expectations, Mode\\n\\n## 1  Introduction\\nCurriculum standards for Grades K-12 prioritize what is most valued and important to teach and learn. Different standards documents reflect different sets of value judgments. For example, documents from different countries reflect disagreement about the amount of emphasis to be put on student-posed statistical questions, probability language, and variability (Groth, 2018). There can be diversity across standards even within a single country; at the outset of this century, there were substantive differences in the appropriate grade levels and roles for many statistical and mathematical concepts across state standards documents in the United States (Smith, 2011). Differences across states in the United States led directly to the writing of Curriculum Focal Points (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM], 2006), which advocated greater coherence and uniformity among state standards. The Focal Points, in turn, were used to help construct the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM, Common Core State Standards Initiative [CCSSI], 2010) for Grades K-8.\\n\\nThe CCSSM are currently the official learning standards for 41 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. territories, and the Department of Defense Education Activity (CCSSI, 2018). Some states that have rescinded or not adopted the CCSSM nonetheless have standards documents that strongly resemble them (Garland, 2016; Loewus, 2015). Hence, the CCSSM exert a sizeable influence in U.S. schools. Given their influence, it is advisable to continuously examine the learning opportunities they provide students and revise or supplement them as needed. When carefully done, such examination and critique can contribute to improved learning opportunities for students. In this article, I offer a constructive critique of the Grades 4–6 statistics standards of the CCSSM by drawing upon my experience conducting research related to this portion of the CCSSM and findings from previous literature. The standards to be considered appear in the Appendix. I argue that, collectively, evidence from these sources suggests that the CCSSM would benefit from revisions to the manner in which they address aggregate distributions, the mode, and statistical contexts.\\n\\n## 2  Source of Empirical Data for the Critique\\nThe writing of this critique was motivated by recurring student thinking patterns I observed while leading two rounds of design-based research. Design-based research involves setting learning goals for students, charting a tentative path for them to achieve the goals, designing lessons to help lead students along the path, and continuously analyzing classroom data to revise the path as necessary to be responsive to the thinking students exhibit (Bakker & van Eerde, 2015; Cobb, Jackson, & Sharpe, 2017). I used this process on two occasions to guide undergraduate researchers in helping groups of children attain goals set forth in the Grade 6 statistics portion of the CCSSM. On each occasion, the research spanned a 10-week period. During the first week, children were interviewed to help set a viable starting point for instruction. During weeks 2–8, the undergraduates and I worked collaboratively to design weekly lessons for the children. Post-assessment interviews were conducted during the ninth week, followed by retrospective analyses during the 10th. Each interaction with children was video recorded and transcribed, and children’s written work was retained for analysis. This article uses examples of student thinking patterns from the first round of design-based research (Groth, 2017; Groth, Kent, & Hitch, 2015) as well as the second round of design-based research to form a constructive critique of the CCSSM.\\n\\nThe undergraduates involved in the research were enrolled in secondary teacher preparation programs. They were charged with implementing the lessons we collaboratively designed. Undergraduates participating in the first round of design-based research described in this report were Rachel and Shantel (pseudonyms). The undergraduates during the second round were Jacob and Olivia (pseudonyms). Each pair of undergraduates worked together over the course of the project to plan, implement, and analyze lessons for groups of four children. The four children in Rachel and Shantel’s group were Jonah, Rhonda, Mary, and Tyrone (pseudonyms). The four children in Jacob and Olivia’s group were Allison, Andrew, Brian, and Claire (pseudonyms). Table 1 contains background information about the children. In selecting children to participate in the research, we aimed for diversity along the dimensions of race, gender, and schooling experiences. All eight children would enter sixth grade within a month after participating; the research aimed to prepare them for concepts they would soon encounter in their school curricula.\\n\\n## 3  Aggregate Distributions\\n### 3.1  Research on Students’ Thinking About Aggregates\\nLearning to perceive aggregates in datasets is important because characteristics such as average and skewness belong to aggregate collections rather than individual data points (Konold et al., 2015). Describing and analyzing distributions using such aggregate characteristics are essential parts of statistical reasoning (Bakker & Hoffmann, 2005). Accordingly, the Grade 6 CCSSM expect students to “Understand that a set of data collected to answer a statistical question has a distribution which can be described by its center, spread, and overall shape” and “Recognize that a measure of center for a numerical dataset summarizes all of its values with a single number, while a measure of variation describes how its values vary with a single number” (CCSSI, 2010, p. 45).\\n\\nOne robust finding in statistics education research is that it is challenging for beginning learners of statistics to shift their focus from individual data points to aggregate distributions. Aridor and Ben-Zvi (2017) observed, “Young students tend to see data as individual cases and measurement values as inseparable from an object or person measured” (p. 38). At times, the graphical representations children use when asked to display data lend themselves to an individual case view rather than an aggregate view. For example, during the first lesson of the first round of our research, children had the task of displaying the scores they obtained during a game that involved rolling pairs of dice. Mary and Tyrone used one bar to represent each roll rather than grouping similar data values together. Their use of this sort of graphical display is not unique. During both rounds of research, other students at times used the same approach, and this graphing strategy has also been observed in previous studies (Bakker & Gravemeijer, 2004; Cobb, 1999). The graphs shown in Figure 1 illustrate the use of case value bars (Konold, 2002) to represent data. Although case value bars represent data correctly and support students’ reasoning at times, they can make it difficult to see some distributional features that are more prominent in graphs such as dotplots that aggregate data more compactly.\\n\\n#### Fig. 1  Case value bars produced by Mary and Tyrone to represent game scores obtained after rolling a pair of dice 10 times. Mary’s graph indicated that she scored 4 on the first trial, 7 on the second and third, 6 on the forth, etc. Similarly, Tyrone’s graph shows scoring 9 on the first trial, 6 on each of the next three trials, etc.\\n\\nWhen students do not perceive datasets as aggregates, they lack a basis from which to describe aggregate characteristics such as typical value. During her pre-interview, Claire responded to an item from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) asking for the typical number of customers at a bike shop over a 5-day span. Claire examined the data and chose the day with the highest number of customers rather than looking for a value near the middle of the others. Mary, Rhonda, Jonah, and Andrew also at times looked for the highest values when asked to determine typical values. Notably, some of these students were able to produce compact aggregate displays such as dotplots during their interviews. However, they did not automatically see dotplots as useful starting points for the task of describing aggregate features. Instead, they initially used them as tools for looking up individual points such as the greatest value, which Konold et al. (2015) characterized as a case value view of data. Their abilities to produce displays to compactly aggregate data did not automatically translate to the ability to actually perceive aggregates and their features.\\n\\nDuring our research, we prioritized helping children adopt more than just a case value approach when reading dotplots. We wanted them to see dotplots as portraits of aggregate distributions rather than just reference tools for looking up and reading individual values. Toward that end, during both rounds of research, we encouraged students to use words such as mountain, hill, peak, hillside, gap, cluster, hole, and outlier to informally describe characteristics of distributions. Doing so helped students think about grouping vertical stacks of data together rather than just looking at individual points and stacks when analyzing dotplots. For example, during one lesson, Brian circled multiple stacks in a given dotplot to indicate they appeared to be a hillside. We gradually focused students’ attention toward clusters of stacks near the centers of data distributions, leading some of them to identify central clusters in data on their own, as Brian did during his post-interview when asked to describe a distribution as part of an Illustrative Mathematics item showing data about the birth weights of 25 puppies.\\n\\n#### Fig. 2  Brian’s post-interview graphical representation for an item about puppy weights.\\n\\nSome work remained to be done, however, to help all students associate the central cluster of a distribution with its typical value. Although Brian produced a helpful graph for the puppy weight item and circled its central cluster, he did not refer to the central cluster when asked to identify a typical puppy weight. Instead, he justified his choice of 18 as the typical weight by saying, “18 is the most popular number.” Although 18 is a reasonable estimate of typical value in this situation, we hoped he would justify his choice by talking about how 18 is within the central cluster, and that an estimate such as 17 would also be reasonable because it is still within the cluster. Claire’s reasoning on post-interview items was generally not as developed as Brian’s. She still chose the highest value when asked for the typical number of customers in a bike shop over the course of a week, as she did during pre-interviews. Others, however, did justify their choice of typical value in reference to clusters of data. Allison, for example, justified her choice of median as a good indicator of typical attendance at a movie theater during a week by talking about how more of the data were grouped around the median than the mean.\\n\\n### 3.2  Reflections on CCSSM Standards Related to Aggregate Distributions\\nDuring both rounds of research, the prospective teachers collaborating with me were surprised at the amount of time it took to help students perceive aggregate features and use them to describe the data. Ideally, the fourth and fifth grade standards would help lead students toward an aggregate view to make sixth grade work more manageable. However, the Grade 4 standard on representing and interpreting data only states that students should:\\n\\n> Make a line plot to display a dataset of measurements in fractions of a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Solve problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions by using information presented in line plots. For example, from a line plot find and interpret the difference in length between the longest and shortest specimens in an insect collection (CCSSI, 2010, p. 31).\\n\\nThis Grade 4 standard and sample item do not go beyond encouraging a case value view of data, since students simply select individual data points and compare them to one another. The Grade 5 standard on representing and interpreting data builds on the Grade 4 standard only by broadening the types of fraction operations students are to do beyond just addition and subtraction. Hence, the Grades 4 and 5 standards miss opportunities to help students begin to develop aggregate reasoning, which children can begin to build at this age (Aridor & Ben-Zvi, 2017; Frischemeier, 2018). Revising or supplementing these standards to have students identify clusters, gaps, and outliers in data they have graphed would help lay the groundwork for Grade 6, when students are to forge connections among the ideas of central cluster, typical value, mean, and median. Without this necessary groundwork on developing an aggregate view of data, helping students develop deep understanding of the content described in the Grade 6 standards is likely to occupy a much greater timespan than generally anticipated or available.\\n\\n## 4  The Mode\\n### 4.1  Research on Students’ Attraction to the Mode\\nA step toward developing an aggregate view of data is to group cases with the same value together. In a dotplot, for example, this is done with stacks; each stack represents a group with the same value. Konold et al. (2015) considered this sort of grouping to be indicative of viewing data as a classifier, and noted that students are often attracted to the tallest stack of data when operating from such a perspective. We noticed the same student tendency to focus on the mode during each round of research, especially during the earliest lessons in each sequence. When describing typical values in distributions represented as dotplots, our students often chose the tallest stack of data. During the first round of research, students eventually kept track of game scores they obtained when rolling two dice by using dotplots. When asked to describe the typical score, they consistently chose whichever stack of data was highest. During the second round of research, students opened several packs of Skittles and kept track of the number of red candies in each pack using a dotplot. When we asked them to predict the number of reds that would be in a pack we had not yet opened, they all used the tallest stack of data to decide. The same attraction to the mode resurfaced when students described typical values in the context of graphs showing the numbers of siblings for each person in a group.\\n\\nGiven students’ tendencies to gravitate toward the mode, we found it necessary to design problems to focus their attention on other graph features. During the first round of research, we altered the game of rolling two dice. Rather than giving each of the four students a pair of fair dice to roll, we gave three of the students fair dice and one student a pair of trick dice weighted to consistently roll 12s. When students pooled their scores from rolling their dice seven times each, the tallest stack in the class dotplot was at 12 rather than being within the main cluster of data. This started a discussion about when the mode is not helpful for describing typical value. During the second round of research, to stop students from focusing only on the tallest stack, we showed them a set of data with no stacks (Figure 3a). We focused class discussion on establishing the meanings of words like cluster, gap, and outlier in the “stackless” dataset because they had mainly considered only individual vertical stacks to be “clusters” in other dotplot displays. Having no vertical stacks prompted them to start to group points representing different, but proximal, values into clusters. When we reintroduced different-sized stacks (Figure 3b), students finally began to speak of multiple proximal vertical stacks as constituting clusters. We then were able to move on to asking students to decide if the tallest stack fell inside or outside the main cluster of stacks when we posed questions about typical value.\\n\\n#### Fig. 3  (a) Datasets (heights of individuals on two soccer teams) intentionally constructed not to have multiple-size stacks to draw students’ attention to features other than the mode; (b) dataset used to reintroduce multiple-size stacks.\\n\\n### 4.2  Reflections on the CCSSM Stance Toward the Mode\\nOur experiences with students’ attraction to the mode, along with those of other researchers (Konold et al., 2015; Mokros & Russell, 1995) indicate that this student thinking tendency must be addressed. The mode is not explicitly mentioned in CCSSM. Mean and median are mentioned in Grade 6, where CCSSM state that students should summarize datasets by,\\n\\n> Giving quantitative measures of center (median and/or mean) and variability (interquartile range and/or mean absolute deviation), as well as describing any overall pattern and any striking deviations from the overall pattern with reference to the context in which the data were gathered (CCSSI, 2010, p. 45).\\n\\nAt minimum, it seems advisable to build the mode into the statement of this standard, given that many students will gravitate toward it, whether directed to do so or not. Additionally, if students began to identify clusters, gaps, and outliers in Grades 4 and 5, as recommended earlier, it could help put sixth grade teachers in position to ask students if the mode lies inside or outside the central cluster of data they are analyzing. Such discussions could help students make sound decisions about measures that are suitable for summarizing data in a given situation rather than automatically opting for the mode.\\n\\n## 5  Statistical Contexts\\n### 5.1  Research on Students’ Interactions With Context\\nAnother student thinking tendency that consistently surprised my undergraduates was that children at times completely ignored the data in problems and responded solely on the basis of their beliefs about its context. This tendency first surfaced during pre-interviews each summer. For instance, when Tyrone was asked to give the typical puppy weight in the Illustrative Mathematics item described earlier, he responded, “When a dog is born, a puppy weighs 5 pounds.” He did not consult the dataset, which showed weights between 13 and 20 ounces, in making this decision. Instead, his judgment was based on an incorrect personal conception of how much dogs usually weigh when born. When Andrew was asked to decide on the typical number of customers over the course of five days at a bike shop, he stated, “I think there would be 87 average for the customers coming.” When asked why he chose 87, he responded, “Because bike stores are kind of popular.” Again, the data in the problem did not seem to play a role in his decision-making.\\n\\nThe tendency to seemingly ignore the data was not limited to pre-interviews. At times, children did the same thing during instructional sessions, even after they had begun to view the data as an aggregate. One instance of this phenomenon occurred as children discussed the data on soccer teams. Claire came up to the board and identified a gap and a cluster in Figure 3(a). She described the gap as “the big open area” and the cluster as where “they are all grouped together,” indicating that she had begun to focus on properties of graphs as wholes. However, she struggled when given the following problem:\\n\\n> A player from Belgium was injured during the game. Using the data from the graph, write three good predictions for how tall you think the substitute player will be. Why did you choose these numbers?\\n\\nClaire wrote 79, 77, and 76 inches as her predictions, even though these values fell in the gap she had identified earlier. She reasoned that being one of these heights would help players “make more goals.” She was not alone in choosing values in the gap. Brian chose 71, 72, and 73 inches because they were “not too tall and not too short.” Andrew chose 75, 76, and 77 inches, stating only, “because I think it is good.” For Claire, and for some of her classmates, viewing the data as an aggregate was a distinct cognitive process from making inferences by coordinating attention to data and context.\\n\\n### 5.2  Reflections on Attention to Context in CCSSM\\nStatistical thinking involves “continual shuttling backward and forward between thinking in the context sphere and the statistical sphere.” This is not a trivial process for students to master. Our study is just one among others showing that students sometimes rely solely upon personal beliefs or experiences and disregard data when making statistical inferences. The thinking processes involved in shuttling back and forth between data and context need concentrated attention in school. The CCSSM do mention the importance of this thinking process in the third standard for mathematical practice, “Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others,” which states that students should, “reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose.” However, this idea is not drawn upon explicitly in the statistics standards until Grade 6, when students are to “summarize datasets in relation to their context” using formal measures of center and spread. As mentioned earlier, the statistics standards for Grades 4 and 5 concentrate upon extracting quantities from graphs and then performing mathematical calculations on them. This is unfortunate, since research shows that children can begin to engage in meaningful conversations about data in relation to its context at this age and earlier.\\n\\nResearch can inform the setting of learning goals that help children begin to balance attention to data and context. In one study of children’s use of context knowledge in statistics, it was noted that students used context knowledge to (a) bring new insight or additional information to the task, (b) explain the data, (c) provide justification or qualification for claims, (d) identify useful data for the task at hand, and (e) state facts that may enhance the picture of the data but are irrelevant to the process of analyzing the data. Findings (a)–(d) can be translated fairly directly into learning goals. Finding (e), on the other hand, points to a thinking process teachers need to be aware of helping students avoid; a learning goal based upon it might ask students to identify contextual details that are irrelevant to the process of analyzing data. In regard to finding (c), it should be noted that justifications students provide for claims can, at times, be based upon inaccurate beliefs about context. So, it would be desirable to set a goal that students should learn to synthesize statistical and contextual knowledge, at times confronting data that contradict their beliefs about a context.\\n\\n## 6  Conclusion\\nOverall, it is encouraging that the CCSSM include attention to statistical thinking in Grades 4–6. However, the Grade 6 expectations seem overwhelming in light of the minimal statistics learning standards in the previous two grade levels. It would be helpful for students to begin to identify aggregates and shuttle back and forth between data and context before they reach sixth grade. Such activities could be done as they construct the types of statistical displays mentioned in the fourth and fifth grade CCSSM. Assigning learning standards to such activities could increase the likelihood they will be done widely across classrooms. By engaging in such activities, students can be in better position to satisfy Grade 6 learning standards, such as deciding on the most appropriate measure of center for a given dataset and context. Revising the CCSSM in the ways that have been discussed could also help the enterprise of teacher education. As noted, the struggles children had discerning aggregates, reasoning about the mode, and working productively with context surprised the prospective teachers with whom I worked each year. Helping prospective teachers anticipate children’s thinking patterns is an essential part of teacher education. The ability to anticipate can help teachers design lesson plans that are responsive to students’ needs and guide classroom discourse in productive directions. Surprising student thinking patterns become less surprising the more visible they are in the standards documents teachers are charged with implementing. So, revisions to the CCSSM that better reflect and develop common patterns of children’s statistical thinking can help students and teachers alike.\\n\\nEven if the recommendations in this critique are not incorporated in future versions of the CCSSM, teachers, curriculum developers, and researchers can look for opportunities to help students develop the essential thinking processes described herein. Many of these opportunities occur in Grades 4–5 as students construct CCSSM-prescribed graphs. As they do so, we can look for opportunities to question children in ways that help them see the aggregate and its specific features, such as central cluster. We can also ask them to justify their conclusions about the data in reference to the data generation context, challenging assumptions that are based solely on personal beliefs. In the process, students gain opportunities to develop essential statistical thinking processes over a longer period of time, making the ambitious goals of the Grade 6 CCSSM more attainable.\\n\\n### Funding\\nThis article is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants DRL-1356001 and DUE-1658968.

The red imported fire ants,Solenopsis invictaBuren, is an invasive pest in many areas of the world that usually performing food-burying during the foraging processes. However, the impacted factors and measureable patterns of this behavior is largely unknown. In the present study, food-burying vs food-transport behaviors ofSolenopsis invictawere observed under laboratory and field conditions. When starved (no food was provided for 37 days) in the laboratory, food (sausage) was consumed by large numbers of ants, and few burying behaviors were observed. However, when food was provided until satiation of the colonies, food-transport was suppressed and significantly more soil particles were relocated on the food and graph paper square (where the food was placed) when compared with these colonies exposed to starved conditions. Videotapes showed that soil particles (1.47 ± 0.09 mm2) were preferentially placed adjacent to (in contact with) the food items at the beginning; and after the edges were covered, ants transported significantly smaller soil particles (1.13 ± 0.06 mm2) to cover the food. Meanwhile, larger particles (1.96 ± 0.08 mm2) were pulled/dragged around (but not in contact with) the food. Interestingly, only a small number of ants, mainly the small workers, were involved in food-burying, and the ants tended to repeatedly transport soil particles. A total of 12 patterns of particle transport were identified, and soil particles were most frequently picked from the foraging arena and subsequently placed adjacent to the food. In the field, almost all released food was actively transported bySolenopsis invictaworkers, and no burying behavior was observed. Our results show that the food-burying behavior ofSolenopsis invictamay be associated with the suppressed foraging activity, and the burying task may be carried out by certain groups of workers.","authors":["Linda M.

In an 11‐year mark–recapture study on a passerine, the dark‐eyed junco, we tested whether density affected dispersal distance and/or fine‐scale spatial genetic structure. Contrary to expectations, we found no effect of predispersal density on dispersal distance or the proportion of locally produced juveniles returning to the population from which they hatched. However, even though density did not affect dispersal distance or natal return rates, we found that density still did affect spatial genetic structure. We found significant positive spatial genetic structure at low densities of (postdispersal) adults but not at high densities. In years with high postdispersal (adult) densities that also had high predispersal (juvenile) densities in the previous year, we found negative spatial genetic structure, indicating high levels of dispersal. We found that density also affected fitness of recruits, and fitness of immigrants, potentially linking these population parameters with the spatial genetic structure detected. Immigrants and recruits rarely nested in low postdispersal density years. In contrast, in years with high postdispersal density, recruits were common and immigrants had equal success to local birds, so novel genotypes diluted the gene pool and effectively eliminated positive spatial genetic structure. In relation to fine‐scale spatial genetic structure, fitness of immigrants and new recruits is poorly understood compared to dispersal movements, but we conclude that it can have implications for the spatial distribution of genotypes in populations.","authors":["Ellen D.

Thus, the ability to anticipate seasonal rainfall shortages, such as the 2015 drought, is particularly important, yet few reliable tools exist for this purpose. Consequently, interpolated surface precipitation observations from the Daymet archive are summarized on daily, annual, and seasonal time scales and compared to the host thermodynamic environment as characterized by the Gálvez–Davison index (GDI), a convective potential parameter designed specifically for the tropics. Complementing the Daymet precipitation totals, ≥1.1 million WSR-88D volume scans between 2002 and 2016 were analyzed for echo tops ≥ 10 000 ft (~3 km) to establish a radar-inferred precipitation activity database for Puerto Rico. The 15-yr record reveals that the GDI outperforms several midlatitude-centric thermodynamic indices, explaining roughly 25% of daily 3-km echo top (ET) activity during each of Puerto Rico’s primary seasons. In contrast, neither mean-layer CAPE, the K index, nor total totals explain more than 11% during any season. When aggregated to the seasonal level, the GDI strongly relates to 3-km ET (R2 = 0.65) and Daymet precipitation totals (R2 = 0.82) during the early rainfall season (ERS; April–July), with correlations weaker outside of this period. The 4-month ERS explains 51% (41%) of the variability to Puerto Rico’s annual rainfall during exceptionally wet (dry) years. These findings are valuable for climate downscaling studies predicting Puerto Rico’s hydroclimate in future atmospheric states, and they could potentially be adapted for operational seasonal precipitation forecasting.","authors":["Paul W.

In today's digital age, reference points for purchases are more prevalent than ever. However, investigations on how certain inputs of the transaction affect these judgments is lacking. Specifically, extant research has failed to account for how the purchase efforts of other consumers can influence one's own price fairness evaluations. Moreover, relatively little empirical research has endeavored to understand the simultaneous cognitive and affective processes that explain how consumers arrive at price fairness judgments. To address these gaps in the literature, we introduce two studies aimed at understanding the process through which the salient efforts of referent consumers serve to mitigate perceptions of price unfairness when two customers pay different prices for the same product. The findings support a dual‐process model whereby the efforts of other (referent) customers serve to simultaneously reduce buyer anger and increase buyer understanding of the price disparity, ultimately mitigating perceptions of price unfairness.","authors":["Judith A.

Although DPN is highly prevalent, molecular mechanisms remain unknown and treatment is limited to pain relief and glycemic control. We provide a novel model of acute DPN in zebrafish ( Danio rerio) larvae. Beginning 5 days postfertilization (dpf), zebrafish expressing nitroreductase in their pancreatic β-cells were treated with metronidazole (MTZ) for 48 h and checked for β-cell ablation 7 dpf. In experimental design, this was meant to serve as proof of concept that β-cell ablation and hyperglycemia are possible at this time point, but we were surprised to find changes in both sensory and motor nerve components. Compared with controls, neurod+sensory neurons were often observed outside the dorsal root ganglia in MTZ-treated fish. Fewer motor nerves were properly ensheathed by nkx2.2a+perineurial cells, and tight junctions were disrupted along the motor nerve in MTZ-treated fish compared with controls. Not surprisingly, the motor axons of the MTZ-treated group were defasciculated compared with the control group, myelination was attenuated, and there was a subtle difference in Schwann cell number between the MTZ-treated and control group. All structural changes occurred in the absence of behavioral changes in the larvae at this time point, suggesting that peripheral nerves are influenced by acute hyperglycemia before becoming symptomatic. Moving forward, this novel animal model of DPN will allow us to access the molecular mechanisms associated with the acute changes in the hyperglycemic peripheral nervous system, which may help direct therapeutic approaches.","authors":["Amanda Rocker","Julia Howell","Gabrielle Voithofer","Jessica Kennett Clark"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology","datePublished":"2019-4-1","aiKeywords":["Prevalence of medical conditions","Diabetic peripheral neuropathy","Impact of diabetes on nerve health"],"facultyKeywords":["Physiology, general","Health sciences, other","Medical clinical science","Biological and biomedical sciences","Neuroscience","Health sciences","Health sciences, general","Public health, general","Neurobiology and neurosciences","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology","Public health","Neurobiology and anatomy","Oncology and cancer biology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00258.2018","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.649.8","type":"paper","title":"Translational Fusion of a G‐protein Coupled‐Receptor from the Hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum Expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans","abstract":"Hookworms are infectious parasites that affect more than 500 million people worldwide, causing extensive morbidity and economic burden in developing countries. Mass drug administration is a current control method, but resistance is of concern. Many hookworm species, including those in the genusAncylostoma, are specialists and require specific host signals to continue development upon infection. Little is known about the signaling mechanisms, although evolutionary conservation between parasitic nematodes and the model organismC. eleganssuggests that G‐protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in amphid neurons are chemosensory detection candidates. The amphid neurons ofC. elegansare exposed to the environment, even during the dauer stage, an alternate phase of larval development that is similar to the parasitic infective juvenile stage. Previous experiments involvingA. ceylanicumtranscriptional GFP fusions inC. elegansidentified putative GPCR genes expressed in neurons during dauer stage. To confirm that hookworm proteins are neuronally localized under dauer conditions, a translational GFP fusion of a putative hookworm GPCR was generated. The entire coding sequence, plus introns, was cloned using homologous recombination‐based, yeast assembly methods to create a C‐terminal GFP fusion. The putativeA. ceylanicumpromoter consisted of the upstream intergenic region, which is approximately 5000 base pairs, and the transcriptional terminator fromC. elegans unc‐54was used. To generate the expression plasmid, amplicons containing homology to the adjacent segment in the assembly were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transformed into yeast. The plasmid was verified by junction‐confirming PCR analysis, restriction enzyme mapping, and sequencing. After microinjection, GFP expression in amphid neurons of stably transformedC. elegansduring the dauer stage would support the hypothesis that this putative GPCR plays a role in reception of host signaling molecules and may provide a possible therapeutic target.\\n\\nSupport or Funding Information\\n\\nThis work was supported by the Salisbury University Faculty Mini‐Grant Program.\\n\\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

It can contaminate fresh groundwater, where it is at risk of being ingested. Currently, arsenic is considered to be dangerous with chronic exposure and ingestion at 10 ug/L as established by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Chronic exposure to arsenic is associated with inflammation, but current studies have show that even at lower doses, there is a link to expression and secretion changes of cytokines within T lymphocytes, particularly with IL‐2 for growth, pro‐inflammatory IFN‐γ and anti‐inflammatory IL‐4. Shifts favoring pro‐ or anti‐inflammatory cytokines can lead to differentiation into TH1 or TH2 cells, which specialize in their immune response. In this study, we aim to investigate how the expression and secretion of these cytokines produced by activated T lymphocytes change as an in‐vitro model of an activated human regulatory immune system. Through our model, we will detect if chronic low level arsenic exposure has the potential to catalyze a change in T lymphocyte function, and therefore overall immune function.\\n\\nPrevious studies have utilized various conditions by which to activate and treat T lymphocytes. As a result, there is variation in how these cytokines are predicted to change. For this study, we obtained human T lymphocytes. They were treated over 24 hours with 10 ng/mL of phytohemagglutinin, a known immune activator, and different concentrations of arsenic to develop a dose response curve, from 20 nM to 500 nM. Viable concentration and cytolethality were determined with differential staining and counting. Cell concentration and cytolethality changes were examined with one‐way ANOVA and Bonferroni's Pairwise T‐test. At 50 nM there is a difference in the cytolethality of the cells in the groups treated with arsenic with or without PHA with p < 0.05.\\n\\nFuture work will include ELISA assays will be performed on all treatment groups of the cell media collected for IL‐2, IL‐4, and IFN‐γ, followed by gene expression analysis via PCR. Experiments at 50 nM will be repeated as well to verify differences in cytolethality that were identified. Additionally, differential time periods for treatments of arsenic and PHA will be used to more accurately model chronic exposure in the cells. These other time points will analyzed through ELISA and gene expression analyses to inform the model of long‐term change within the cells of the cytokine profiles.\\n\\nSupport or Funding Information\\n\\nThis research is supported by the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Salisbury University Honors College, and the Salisbury University Henson School of Science Grant.\\n\\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

Although faculty often list learning techniques and developing critical thinking skills as goals for laboratory, students tend to focus on affective goals, such as finishing lab early and obtaining good grades. The goals of faculty have been thoroughly investigated through both qualitative and large-scale quantitative studies. However, studies on student goals for laboratory coursework have primarily been conducted using qualitative methods. In order to provide a more comprehensive idea of students’ goals in the laboratory, we have designed a brief, online survey. The survey was used to investigate students’ goals in the laboratory and build on existing literature by including survey questions that catalog how students plan on achieving their goals. In this study, we discuss results about students’ goals and achievement strategies at the beginning of the semester and after completing the laboratory portion of the course. Anonymous responses, via the online survey, were collected from undergraduate students enrolled in chemistry courses at two Midwestern universities. These results are intended to inform the discussion among faculty regarding how to change laboratory coursework and the instruction to better align faculty and student goals.\\n\\n**Keywords:** First-Year Undergraduate, General, Second-Year Undergraduate, Upper-Division Undergraduate, Laboratory Instruction, Testing, Laboratory Management, Chemical Education Research\\n\\n**Cited By:** 27 Publications\\n\\n**Metrics:** Article Views: 2170, Altmetric: 5, Citations: 27\\n\\n**DOI:** [10.1021/acs.jchemed.8b00984](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.8b00984)\\n\\n**Contact:** Marcy H.

In the Hawaiian Archipelago, theLeptoserisspecies complex form the most spatially extensive mesophotic coral ecosystem known and provide habitat for a unique community. To study how the ecophysiology ofLeptoserisspecies relates to symbiont–host specialization and understand the mechanisms responsible for coral energy acquisition in extreme low light environments, we examinedSymbiodinium(endosymbiotic dinoflagellate) photobiological characteristics and the lipids and isotopic signatures fromSymbiodiniumand coral hosts over a depth‐dependent light gradient (55–7μmol photons m−2s−1, 60–132 m). Clear performance differences demonstrate different photoadaptation and photoacclimatization across this genus. Our results also show that flexibility in photoacclimatization depends primarily onSymbiodiniumtype. Colonies harboringSymbiodiniumsp.COI‐2showed significant increases in photosynthetic pigment content with increasing depth, whereas colonies harboringSymbiodiniumspp.COI‐1andCOI‐3showed variability in pigment composition, yield measurements for photosystem II, as well as size and density ofSymbiodiniumcells. Despite remarkable differences in photosynthetic adaptive strategies, there were no significant differences among lipids ofLeptoserisspecies with depth. Finally, isotopic signatures of both host andSymbiodiniumchanged with depth, indicating that coral colonies acquired energy from different sources depending on depth. This study highlights the complexity in physiological adaptations within this symbiosis and the different strategies used by closely related mesophotic species to diversify energy acquisition and to successfully establish and compete in extreme light‐limited environments.","authors":["Ruth D.

Gilg is an economically important tree species that produce the highly prized agarwood. In recent years, agarwood production has been seriously threatened by the outbreak of Heortia vitessoides Moore, a leaf-eating pest that shows gregariousness during the larval stage. However, little attention has been paid to the aggregation behavior of H. vitessoides larvae. In the present study, we collected 102 cohorts of H. vitessoides larvae (13,173 individuals in total) in the wild; 54 cohorts were comprised of the same-instar larvae, and 48 cohorts were comprised of larvae with different developmental stages (instars). In general, young larvae (<third instar) tended to form large aggregations, whereas older-instar larvae were either solitary or formed small aggregations. Laboratory studies showed a strong aggregation tendency in the newly hatched and second-instar larvae of H. vitessoides, whenever the individuals originated from the same or different sibling cohorts. In addition, all newly hatched larvae died within two days after they were isolated. When newly hatched larvae were initially assigned in 10-larvae cohorts (containing sibling individuals) or 20-larvae cohorts (either containing individuals originating from the same or different sibling cohorts), their larval survivorship, duration of larval stage, and adult emergence were not significantly different. Interestingly, combining avermectin-treated larvae (donors) with untreated ones (receptors) significantly decreased larval survivorship and adult emergence of receptors, indicating a horizontal transfer of avermectin among H. vitessoides larvae. This study enhances our understanding of the population ecology of H. vitessoides, and may bring novel insights into the management strategies against this pest.","authors":["Liping Tang","Xuan Chen","Zhengya Jin","Shiping Liang","Jinkun Zhang","Xiujun Wen","Cai Wang","Zhijia Huang","Jiacheng Cai","Zhaohui Sun"],"journal":"Forests","datePublished":"2019-4-12","aiKeywords":["Impact of pest on agarwood production","Population ecology of Heortia vitessoides","Aggregation behavior of larvae","Survivorship and development of larvae","Pest management strategies"],"facultyKeywords":["Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Entomology","Ecology","Plant sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Agronomy and crop science","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences nec","Epidemiology and biostatistics","Microbiology and immunology","Plant pathology and phytopathology","Microbiology, general","Ecology and evolutionary biology","Biological and biomedical sciences, other","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10040331","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},{"id":"10.1080/10656219.2019.1631236","type":"paper","title":"We’re Missing Someone: The Lack of Black Leaders in Maryland Church Schools","abstract":"This qualitative study explored perceptions of leadership within the Maryland Association of Christian Schools (MACS) concerning the lack of Black administrators—specifically, the perceptions of school board members, school leaders, and the founding documents.

The assessment of the erosion and deposition balance is therefore crucial to find out the best restoration strategies. This work presents the first results of an integrated approach for monitoring channels’ morphodynamics over a six-year time frame in a low energy restored salt marsh at Poplar Island (Maryland, USA). The combined use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and traditional GPS cross sections surveys was adopted to detect the current shape of the channels. Due to the site extent of 400 m by 400 m, three missions were performed flying at a 40 m altitude. The comparison with the initial as-built survey showed the effects of erosion and deposition phenomena. The technique provided reliable results at low cost, allowing an accurate assessment of the morphodynamics over time, thanks to both high spatial resolution and the precise imageries georeferencing.","authors":["CORINNE CORBAU","COURT J.

Setting wadditional = 0 is viable for spontaneous reactions, but for nonspontaneous reactions, wadditional ≠ 0 as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, ΔH ≠ qP for nonspontaneous reactions. Moreover, nonexpansion work is important for many interesting and important spontaneous reactions in biology (e.g., muscular movement, nerve signal transmission) and in modern society (e.g., batteries); incorporating wadditional into ΔH allows for a more accurate discussion of the energy flow in these reactions. In this paper, I show that ΔH ≠ qP for nonspontaneous reactions, and I discuss how ΔH must be partitioned between qP and wadditional for several kinds of reactions according to the second law of thermodynamics.

Zooming in on the discoursal framings of a recent year of job advertisements on a popular, open-source forum for linguists supplemented with qualitatively and quantitatively sourced data from international, national, and local institutional contexts, the paper examines how macrocontextual pushes toward political populism combined with a synchronous tightening of job markets in academia have enacted a plethora of labels for temporary work in lieu of permanent academic positions—now, increasingly the only option for job seekers in a hypercompetitive academic market. In this manufacturing of euphemization discourse, we witness the invention of novel, microlinguistically rendered lexicalizations of semiotic redundancy in academic capitalism’s own obfuscation of profit margins, and a concomitant manufacturing of a new discourse of rationality in which floating semiotic signifiers at multiple scales deploy nationality-criteria to justify ethnic exclusion and/or entry into academic space. More crucially, in these commonsensical framings, we encounter both causation and consequence of newly enacted barriers to transnational mobility.

This study explored the technical adequacy of three procedural and two conceptual algebra screening measures. We administered three rounds of assessments throughout an algebra course to 2,021 secondary students of 31 teachers in three states. Assessments included procedural and conceptual screening measures and additional criterion measures: teacher ratings of students’ algebra proficiency, course grades, results of two project-specific algebra proficiency exams, and state test scores. Descriptive and correlation analyses were used to investigate measure scores, alternate-form and test–retest reliability, concurrent validity, and predictive validity. Procedural measure results indicated high levels of reliability ( r = .72–.99), and moderate concurrent and predictive validity ( r = .36–.64; .36–.58). The conceptual measures produced moderate to low levels of validity ( r = .10–.44). The procedural measure results suggest they may be suitable for use as screening measures, pending further revision and diagnostic testing, while the conceptual measures did not produce acceptable results for current implementation.

Approximately 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop DPN, which is characterized by disrupted sensory and/or motor functioning, with treatment limited to pain management. Zebrafish ( Danio rerio) are an emerging animal model used to study a number of metabolic disorders, including diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and delayed wound healing have all been demonstrated in zebrafish. Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that following the ablation of the insulin-producing β-cells of the pancreas (and subsequent hyperglycemia), the peripheral nerves begin to show signs of dysregulation. In this study, we take a different approach, taking advantage of the transdermal absorption abilities of zebrafish larvae to extend the period of hyperglycemia. Following 5 days of 60 mM d-glucose treatment, we observed motor axon defasciculation, disturbances in perineurial glia sheath formation, decreased myelination of motor axons, and sensory neuron mislocalization. This study extends our understanding of the structural changes of the peripheral nerve following induction of hyperglycemia and does so in an animal model capable of potential DPN drug discovery in the future.\\n\\nNEW & NOTEWORTHY Zebrafish are emerging as a robust model system for the study of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and impaired wound healing.

Kinesis is hypothesized to enhance predator defense in small terrestrial and semiaquatic turtles and has evolved multiple times since the early Cretaceous. This complex phenotype is nonfunctional and far from fully differentiated following embryogenesis. Instead, kinesis develops slowly in juveniles, providing a unique opportunity to illustrate the postembryonic origins of an adaptive trait. To this end, we examined ventral shell (plastral) kinesis in emydine box turtles and found that hatchling plastron shape differs from that of akinetic‐shelled relatives, particularly where the hinge that enables kinesis differentiates. We also demonstrated shape changes relative to plastron size in juveniles, coinciding with a shift in the carapace‐plastron structural connection, rearrangement of ectodermal plates, and bone repatterning. Furthermore, because the shell grows larger relative to the head, complete concealment of the head and extremities is only achieved after relative shell proportions increase. Structural alterations that facilitate the box turtle's transformation are probably prepatterned in embryos but require function‐induced changes to differentiate in juveniles. This mode of delayed trait differentiation is essential to phenotypic diversification in turtles and perhaps other tetrapods.","authors":["Chelsea M.

Second, how do they experience and understand their sociocultural identities as contributors to their practices as critical educators and the associated outcomes? Two findings are discussed. First, the teachers felt greatest agency and success within their classrooms (in comparison to other institutional spaces) to enact social justice–oriented curricula, instruction, and other educational practices, using relationship-building with students as the foundation of their work. Second, identity constructs of gender, age, and race significantly mediated the teachers’ relationship-building efforts with colleagues and administrators, the teachers’ feelings of agency, and their activities and outcomes related to justice-oriented change at institutional levels beyond the classroom.

Ecology and Recovery of Eastern Old-Growth Forests. Island Press, Chicago, Illinois, USA, 2018.\\n\\nWhen most people pick up a book about eastern old-growth forests, they want to know how many of these wild forests remain, where they are, what makes them unique, how we can preserve the few left, and how we can help some of our forests recover their original, pre-logged, condition. A 1996 book edited by Mary Byrd Davis addressed all of these questions and more. But that book is now more than twenty years old. My review will focus on the similarities and differences between the new Barton and Keeton book and the earlier Davis book. This seems appropriate since both books were published by Island Press and the newer book's cover seems to purposefully resemble Davis's book, and indeed both spines proclaim “EASTERN OLD-GROWTH FORESTS” in caps. Reaching for one or the other on the shelf requires a close look to tell them apart.\\nAlthough there is a nod to biodiversity, the emphasis in this volume leans instead toward natural disturbance dynamics, threats to the forest, and silviculture. The disturbance chapter by D'Amato et al. does an excellent job at presenting the newest research in disturbance dynamics. The chapter includes discussions of wind, specific insects, pathogens, wildfires, ice storms, and drought and then ranks all the various disturbances by severity and scale. Much of this chapter, however, veers into a discussion of ecological silviculture. Most ecologists, myself included, are in favor of more sensitive forest management that mimics natural disturbances and promotes the structures found in old-growth forests: such as tip-up mounds, increased coarse woody debris, standing dead trees, and larger living trees; but the old-growth forests we study, and try to preserve, exist because they have escaped both silviculture and severe natural disturbance. By definition (pg. 2), old-growth forests contain old trees and are relatively undisturbed by people. Silviculture, no matter how sensitive, is a human-inflicted disturbance.\\nThere is a very good biodiversity chapter by Gregory McGee, but it primarily addresses vascular plants, mosses, lichens, fungi, and small invertebrates such as mites, springtails, and spiders. In contrast, Davis's 1996 book also had chapters on vertebrate relationships with old-growth forests including salamanders, birds, carnivores, and even humans. With the exception of a few paragraphs about salamanders, the new book does not address the relationship of vertebrates with old-growth forests.\\nThe chapter on forest–stream interaction in eastern old-growth forests by Dana Warren et al. is a useful addition that was not covered in Davis's book. As Warren's team notes on page 159, “streams bordered by old-growth forests are profoundly different from those surrounded by younger forests.” The importance of large dead wood in streams to fish and macroinvertebrates is discussed. Also discussed are the forest influences of stream light regimes and nutrient cycling on stream ecology. Those interested in stream restoration in wooded habitats should pay particular attention to this chapter.\\nSimilar to the Davis book, there are chapters describing specific old-growth forest communities such as bottomland hardwood forests, pine woodlands, Southern Appalachian mountain forests, hardwood–hemlock forests, and boreal forests. These chapters will be of interest to anyone who works in those particular ecosystems. The pine chapter by Robert Peet et al. is particularly well done. They have included a map and a table that organizes the remaining old-growth southeastern pine savannas into useful categories. The boreal forest chapter by Kneeshaw et al. has an interesting discussion of planning for natural disturbances by managing on a landscape scale instead of a single forest scale. But, as they remark on pages 146–147, “such foresight and long-term large-scale planning is an aspirational concept that remains a long way from being made operational.”\\nMost troubling to me was the chapter on silviculture by Keeton et al. On page 238, they pose the interesting question: “Is it better to let old growth recover passively or could silvicultural methods be used to restore or increase the representation of old-growth characteristics in secondary forests?” Instead of presenting data to answer that question, the idea of passive recovery is waved away with a pen stroke. They write: “In the Anthropocene, the idea of just letting nature take its course no longer seems to be an adequate strategy.” Without further proof, I am not convinced of this. A paragraph later they write: “Even if passive management could restore healthy old-growth forests, the process in the existing second-growth would often involve a delay of another 60–150 years.”\\nWhile their arguments to use active management to increase structural complexity in second-growth forests are persuasive and could lead to increased habitat types and increased biodiversity in the short term, time is integral to the development of an old-growth forest. Thinking that putting more woody debris on the forest floor, and scarifying and pushing over some trees, will create an old-growth forest is like thinking you can make a teenager an elderly person by dying their hair gray. Calling this sort of management “old-growth silviculture” is somewhat misleading. “Old-growth-like silviculture” or “silviculture for old-growth characteristics” would be less confusing. Also, when discussing the benefits or drawbacks of active management for creating old-growth-like characteristics in a specific forest, one should be very clear if the management is for a forest that will continue to have wood fiber taken out of it (a “working forest”), or if it is a preserved forest where natural forces will be allowed to prevail. Silviculture, even as sensitive and well-intentioned as the type described here, may not be appropriate for the latter. These distinctions are not well developed here, and the emphasis seems to be toward managing for “multiple benefits” with talk of rotation periods or entry times. This well-researched and well-written chapter would be an excellent addition to a silviculture book, but it felt out of place in a volume titled Ecology and Recovery of Eastern Old-Growth Forests.\\nThe chapter on silviculture would be stronger if it also discussed the drawbacks to active management. Do we really need to mimic natural disturbance processes when they are still at work? Does the introduction of humans with chain saws (for creating snags and coarse woody debris) and heavy equipment (for tipping over trees) have any negative consequences for other forest organisms (such as herbaceous plants, snails, and turtles)? The introduction of nonnative invasive plants is a huge risk associated with any sort of active management these days. A chapter by John Gunn and David Orwig spells out the impact of this growing threat, along with all the rest of the invaders from the emerald ash borer to beech bark disease.\\nIn the past twenty years, climate change has become an important factor in forest disturbance and in the value of carbon sequestration by old-growth forests. Discussions of climate change are to be found in many of these chapters. A very useful chapter by Keeton discusses our current understanding of carbon dynamics in forests as they age and change. Again, however, the discussion moves toward silviculture. Silviculture for old-growth characteristics is encouraged for working forests as a way to increase carbon stocking and potentially reap the financial rewards of the carbon market.\\nThe Wildlands and Woodlands vision Foster (2017) promoted by Harvard Forest for the New England landscape calls for 10% of the forests to be treated as wildlands to protect biodiversity and wilderness. Since we are nowhere near that percentage at present, we need to have serious discussions about how we can begin to let formerly logged forests become wild once again. It would have been nice to see that discussion in this new book. As biologist Victor Scheffer (1973) says, “The wisdom, goodness, and greatness of Man will be measured not wholly by technical power over the wild things of Earth but also by his moral strength in letting them be.”\\nAlthough this book is an important reference for those studying eastern old-growth forests, it will not replace Davis's iconic 1996 volume.\\n\\nLiterature Cited\\n\\nDavis, M.

Birdsong was originally thought to be a trait used primarily by male songbirds for mate attraction and male/male contest. However, ornithologists have long known that females sing in many tropical songbirds, often for similar functions to male song. Yet, studies of female song in temperate regions remain scarce. Increasing our understanding of the function of female song in temperate species is a powerful step towards discerning the selective pressures that maintain elaborate female signals. In the last few decades, studies of temperate species have highlighted five major functional categories of female song. Using a modeling framework, based on all known functions of song in other species, we tested the function of female song in eastern bluebirds. The modeling framework allowed us to test the effect of multiple complex behaviors simultaneously to predict female song function. Additionally, modeling mitigated issues of multiple testing across the five different functional categories. We found that female song in eastern bluebirds is primarily used in pair communication. Specifically, females sing to strengthen and maintain long-term pair bonds. Strengthening pair-bonds may be advantageous for eastern bluebirds as pairs that remain together between nesting attempts and between years have higher reproductive success. We demonstrate a clear link between the function of female song in pair communication and the likely selective force of long-term pair bonds acting on eastern bluebird reproductive success. Additionally, our study highlights a major function of female song in a temperate species.","authors":["Casey D Haines","Evangeline M Rose","Derek A Coss","Sheridan A Danquah","Kevin E Omland","Colin E Studds"],"journal":"Behavioral Ecology","datePublished":"2019-8-3","aiKeywords":["Communication in birds","Female bird song","Reproductive success","Social behavior in animal species","Evolutionary pressures"],"facultyKeywords":["Cognitive neuroscience","Ecology","Ecology and evolutionary biology","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Biological and biomedical sciences","Neuroscience","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Ecology, evolutionary biology, and epidemiology","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences","Zoology and animal biology","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Neurobiology and neurosciences","Neurobiology and anatomy","Biology biological sciences, general","Interdisciplinary computer sciences","Evolutionary biology","Biological and biomedical sciences, other"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arz130","licenseUrl":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model"},{"id":"10.1080/00927872.2019.1663383","type":"paper","title":"Galkin’s lower bound conjecture holds for the Grassmannian","abstract":"Let Gr(k,n) be the Grassmannian.

These participants completed three computer-driven tests from a battery of measurements that assess various components of cognitive control (CC)—One Card Learning Test (attention), Two Back Card Test (working memory), and Revised Groton Learning Maze Test (inhibition/ executive function). Testing took place after a bout of sedentary activity, and two weeks later, after a bout of individualized PA (based on VO2 max).Due to the high intellect/high fit nature of the participants, there was no statistical significance with the One Card learning or Two Card Back Tests (i.e., many reached the test ‘ceiling’ on the initial attempt). After controlling for sex, age, BMI, estimated aerobic capacity, and GPA, there were significant differences between sedentary and physical activity conditions in both moves-per-second (adjusted b-coefficient = 0.132, p < 0.001) and duration (adjusted b-coefficient = −22,653 ms, p < 0.001) within the Revised Groton Maze Learning Test. The differences between conditions represented a medium-to-large effect.

This article therefore attempts to answer the research question of how environmental uncertainty within a firm’s supply chain, impacts firm financial performance. We further evaluate the role of supply chain risk management practices in mitigating the negative impact of such disruption events. To answer the research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using both primary and secondary data. The results show that environmental uncertainty has a negative impact on firm financial performance, with entrepreneurial managerial capitalism mediating the impact. However, organisations that adopt macro and network supply chain risk management practices are able to improve managerial decision making frame, and mitigate the negative impact of environmental uncertainty on firm financial performance.

In each period, buyers share forecasts of future orders with their supplier. The participants in the game play the role of a buyer, while the supplier is automated. Our experimental findings suggest that rewarding forecast accuracy in allocating inventory can significantly improve the order forecast accuracy of the buyers and reduce their forecast inflation behavior.

This termite cultures symbiotic Termitomyces in the fungal combs, which are challenged by antagonistic microbes such as Trichoderma fungi.

We also investigated the colony-initiation preference of paired O. formosanus adults to soil treated with Trichoderma conidia (T. koningii or T. longibrachiatum) versus untreated soil. Tunneling-choice tests showed that sand containing conidia of nearly all Trichoderma fungi tested (except T. harzianum) significantly decreased tunneling activity in O. formosanus workers compared with untreated sand. Aggregation-choice test showed that T. koningii, T. atroviride and T. spirale repelled O. formosanus workers, whereas T. longibrachiatum and T. hamatum attracted termites. There was no significant difference in proportions of paired adults that stayed and laid eggs in the soil blocks treated with conidia of Trichoderma fungi and untreated ones.

We collected data from 443 accounting majors at four geographically disbursed U.S. universities using a battery of psychometric instruments. With these data, we analyzed the relations between role stressors, psychological health, burnout, and departure intentions, and assessed the extent to which individual resilience levels served as a positive influence by enhancing health, and diminishing burnout and departure intentions. We found sources of role stress to have significant negative associations with psychological health, and significant positive associations with academic burnout (direct), and departure intentions (indirect). However, resilience counteracted those associations through its direct positive association with psychological health, and direct negative association with burnout. Resilience also had a significant indirect negative association with departure intentions through its direct associations with psychological health (positive) and burnout (negative).\\n\\n### KEYWORDS:\\nrole stress, academic burnout, departure intentions, resilience\\n\\n### Disclosure statement\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\\n\\n### Notes\\n1. Excessive turnover in public accounting has long been a topic of academic and practitioner interest. See, e.g. Leathers (1971), Hermanson et al. (1995), Brundage and Koziel (2010), and Chong and Monroe (2015).\\n2. http://www.insidepublicaccounting.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-2018-IPA-National-Benchmarking-Report.pdf.\\n3. In 1994, the number of test takers was 140,232, and by 2017, that number had dropped to 95,645 (Ng, 2019).\\n4. In a subsequent study, Byrne and Flood (2005) found among a sample of 129 first-year accounting students at an Irish university, that 84% expected (hoped) that their self-esteem would increase as a result of matriculating in the program.\\n5. Technically, Brown et al. (2013) found that accounting majors had a lower level of narcissism than other undergraduate and graduate business students, as well as a general population of college-age students. The authors citing Morrison (1997, p. 375) stated that ‘…in adults, a reasonable amount of healthy narcissism allows the individual's perception of his needs to be balanced in relation to others’. They also quoted DuBrin (2012, ii) who stated ‘A healthy dose of narcissism can facilitate career success, because reasonable concern with the self helps a person think of achieving important goals and being admired as a leader’.\\n6. Related to the concept of resilience are the concepts of ‘grit’ (e.g., Duckworth, 2016) and ‘growth mindset’ (Dweck, 2006). Prior research finds that accounting students with higher levels of grit have greater intensions to become professionally qualified accountants (Aziz et al., 2017). Meanwhile, accounting students with growth mindsets are more likely to aspire to work for a Big Four accounting firm (Liu et al., 2018) and are more capable of improving performance on exams (Ravenscroft et al., 2012).\\n7. The three items that comprise the role ambiguity scale (denoted as RA in Appendix A) are reverse-scored.\\n8. The MBI-GS[S] is a derivative of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the latter instrument arguably the leading measure of burnout in organizational settings as evidenced by the 15,050 citations (as of November 2019) to the publication that described its development (Maslach et al., 1986).\\n9. We also conducted an exploratory factor analysis of the 16 MBI-GS[S] items and found that they all loaded on their respective dimensions as prescribed by Maslach et al. (2016).\\n10. A series of analyses of variance revealed no significant differences in any of the primary study constructs by school. Thus, the data from all four schools were combined in all of the ensuing analyses.\\n11. These composite indicators appear in Table 2 below as RC1, RC2, RA1, RA2, RO1, RO2, Health1, Health2, and TI1, and TI2.\\n12. The maximum likelihood (ML) method CFA output indicated significant multivariate kurtosis with a Mardia’s Coefficient of 48.27 and a normalized estimate of 23.62. Bentler (2006) notes that that normalized estimate values greater than 3 are indicative of nontrivial positive kurtosis, but cautions that modelling statistics may not be affected until the values exceed 5–6 or higher. We incorporated the elliptical estimation procedure to address the kurtosis issue.\\n13. The Wald test is not theory driven, i.e., it is a sample-specific, post-hoc procedure. Therefore, to determine if the associations identified in this investigation hold, replication with another sample is necessary.\\n14. Chong and Monroe (2015) state that as long as the conceptual integrity of a model is maintained, dropping non-significant parameters from a saturated structural model is an acceptable practice.\\n15. Hooper et al. (2008) note that the relative/normed chi-square (χ2/df) minimizes the impact of sample size on the model chi-square while acknowledging that there is no consensus regarding an acceptable ratio for this statistic, with recommendations ranging from a high of 5.0 (Wheaton et al., 1977) to a low of 2.0 (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007).\\n16. For the multi-sample analysis by GPA, we split the sample into two groups: students who reported a GPA below 3.4 (n=205) and students who reported a GPA of 3.4 or above (n=234).\\n17. Chong and Monroe (2015), quoting Kerlinger and Pedhazur (1973, p. 19) state that this technique ‘can be used to determine whether the pattern of correlations for a set of observations is consistent with a specific theoretical formulation’.\\n18. Our model has its roots in Fogarty et al.’s (2000) Beyond the Role Stress Model which was drawn from the occupational health, applied psychology, and related literature. One important extension of the Fogarty et al. (2000) model that we made was to include psychological health as a burnout mediator, which follows the medical student burnout literature (Dahlin et al., 2011; Backović et al., 2012).\\n19. As noted in Appendix A, all three role stressors are measured on a five-point score ranging from A=strongly disagree, to E=strongly agree.\\n20. The relationship between hardiness and resilience can be gleaned from the authors’ (p. 566) statement that ‘hardiness has emerged as a pattern of attitudes and skills that is a pathway to resilience under stressful circumstances’. 21. Within the U.S., our findings also have noteworthy implications for public universities in states with performance-based funding policies. These policies use performance metrics such as freshman retention rates (i.e., the percentage of first-year students that continue into their second year) and six-year graduation rates to determine the level of funding provided to public universities.\\n22. While these admonitions are related to studies of the accounting work environment, they appear equally valid in academic accounting settings.","authors":["Bob G. Wood","David J. Emerson","Kenneth J.

Natural history observations and published data are equivocal on whether frosted elfin caterpillars pupate below or above the soil surface, and some evidence suggests that pupation sites differ for caterpillars that feed on lupine (Lupinus spp.) versus wild indigo (Baptisia spp.). Pupation site has important implications for management because pupae located beneath the soil surface will likely be afforded greater protection from fire than those above the soil surface. Our study of both lupine- and indigo-feeding larvae at a single site in Worcester County, Maryland, found that pupation occurs above the soil surface in the leaf litter 92% of the time, and does not differ significantly with food plant preference.

HFCs are typically small in magnitude, a result often attributed to power of the analyses. Animal behaviors often affect fitness and are often heritable to some degree. We hypothesized that heterozygosity influences behavior, which, in turn, potentially influences fitness. Specifically, in red‐backed salamanders,Plethodon cinereus, which have limited dispersal and the potential for inbreeding, we tested whether heterozygosity, as estimated from six microsatellite loci, affected home range size, juvenile growth, and survival. We found that salamanders with higher heterozygosity had larger home ranges and grew faster, which is indicative of reproductive success. However, we found no effects of heterozygosity on survival. We conclude that, because activity inP. cinereusis tightly linked to food uptake and mass gain, heterozygosity influences growth via effects on foraging behavior. Future research should investigate how the relationship between heterozygosity, behavior, and fitness may be affected or mediated by endocrine or immune systems.","authors":["Tamar C.

In the United States, Chinese Americans comprise the largest Asian demographic. Aim: To describe EOL wishes, which define a good death for Chinese Americans. Method: Qualitative study using focus groups. A convenience sample of 60 Chinese Americans was recruited from a community organization in Maryland. Ten focus group discussion sessions were conducted. Results: Wishes at the EOL that defined a good death for the participants in this study included being pain-free, not being a burden to family, being with family, having a trusted physician, maintaining dignity, and prayer.

Findings showed that parents were overwhelmingly in support of schools being involved in addressing the mental health needs of students. Anxiety, depression, and bullying were the top emotional and behavioral issues that parents recognized as the main challenge for their child.

Regenerative justice is the coupling of restorative justice with the notion of generative justice, which involves the explicit and intentional discovery and building of life meanings, as well as the consideration of the relationships that those meanings have with wrongdoing and ‘making things right’. This exploration comes about after first considering restorative justice, then providing a critique that uncovers potential blind spots in restorative practice. Logotherapeutic techniques, including: Socratic dialogue, attitude modulation, and dereflection, are used by therapists to help people discover meaning and purpose and have successfully assisted crime victims and offenders. Borrowing from these techniques and specific questioning approaches, restorative dialogue facilitators can enhance restorative practice, particularly in the phases of preparation for restorative dialogue and follow-up after restorative dialogue, by deliberately emphasizing meaning-building discussions (generative justice). Therefore, regenerative justice synthesizes the restoration of people and relationships with the generation of peaceful and healing meanings that can help stakeholders in wrongdoing make sense out of suffering and move forward with a sense of purpose. An example of this process is illustrated in a victim-offender dialogue in a crime of severe violence, where meaning-building can be particularly powerful.\\n\\nKeywords: Restorative justice, generative justice, regenerative justice, logotherapy, meaning, dialogue","authors":["Toran Hansen","Mark Umbreit"],"journal":"Contemporary Justice Review","datePublished":"2018-3-30","aiKeywords":["meaning-making","victim-offender dialogue","restorative justice","regenerative justice","generative justice","relationship restoration","healing and purpose"],"facultyKeywords":["Public policy analysis, general","Public policy analysis","Criminology","Psychology","Counseling and applied psychology nec","Health sciences, other","Health sciences","Counseling and applied psychology","Social sciences, other","Health services research","Research and experimental psychology","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Social sciences","Social sciences nec","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Mental health, counseling, and therapy services and sciences","Research and experimental psychology nec","Sociology, general","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Criminal justice and corrections","Public health, general","Social psychology","Public health"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10282580.2018.1455508","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1670/16-185","type":"paper","title":"Differential Survival and the Effects of Predation on a Color Polymorphic Species, the Red-Backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus)","abstract":"Color polymorphism is common in many species, and color morph frequency is affected by differences in ecological and evolutionary pressures on each color morph. Plethodon cinereus, the Red-Backed Salamander, has two common color morphs, striped and unstriped, that vary in frequency among populations. Plethodon cinereus color morphs differ in their escape behaviors when exposed to predators and in their tail autotomization rates; this may result from differential predation. Although these previous studies indirectly implicated differential predation, we directly tested the hypothesis that color morphs differed in survival and whether one morph was depredated at a higher rate. We determined the survival of each color morph over 3 yr with the use of mark–recapture data. We first compared frequencies of color morphs in juveniles and adults, and then estimated whether color morphs had different survival rates with the statistical program MARK. We found that frequency of striped salamanders was lower in adults than in juveniles, implying that fewer striped individuals survived to adulthood. In addition, color and age best explained survival probability during spring, but not fall, seasons. To test the effects of color morph on predation experimentally, we used clay models to determine the effects of avian and mammalian predators. We found more attacks on striped clay models by avian predators compared to the unstriped models, but we found no difference in attacks by mammals. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that there is differential predation in P. cinereus, with more predation on, and lower survival in, the striped morph.","authors":["Alexa H.

Some studies have suggested that, especially at moderate to high exposure levels, arsenite is toxic to individuals who are chronically exposed through drinking water, characterized by an increase in inflammatory cytokine release, specifically interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) and tumor necrosis factor‐ɑ (TNFɑ). Other epidemiological studies at low to moderate exposures did not find the same correlation with inflammation. We aim to characterize and quantify the effects of arsenite exposure to macrophages to gauge any potential inflammatory response.\\n\\nM1 macrophages are key players in inflammatory response and secrete IL‐1β and TNFɑ in response to Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) released by neighboring cells undergoing necrosis, in coordination with Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), molecules associated with pathogens, such as lipopolysaccharide, or LPS. We obtained a murine macrophage cell line to study the effects of arsenic on inflammatory cytokine secretionin vitro. A dose response curve was developed including varying concentrations of arsenite with and without 50 ng/mL LPS, using the same treatments without arsenite as controls. Cytolethality was determined by differential staining and counting. Secretion of cytokines after 24 hours of exposure was quantified using ELISA. Results were statistically analyzed using Student's t‐test and One‐Way ANOVA. IL‐1β was not differentially secreted for any concentration of arsenite, but cytolethality and TNFɑ secretion were significantly increased for 200 nM arsenite with LPS as opposed to 200 nM arsenite without LPS, possibly indicating that some inflammatory augmentation occurs in the presence of both arsenite exposure and a PAMP.\\n\\nFuture steps include analyzing alterations in expression of genes responsible for proteins involved in the secretory pathways of these cytokines. For example, the genes involved in manufacturing the pieces of the NLRP3 inflammasome, key in production of IL‐1β, or TNFɑ Converting Enzyme, involved in cleavage of the TNFɑ precursor, may be potential targets. Additionally, we will explore differential DNA methylation using methylation sensitive and insensitive restriction enzyme digestion to examine epigenetic control of cytokine secretion in response to arsenite.

As he describes here, Das has been “greatly influenced” by the transition and transformation of India from colonialism to postcolonialism. His writings — with dramatic suspense, magical realism, and a style that with a minimal touch can convey nuances of character, motivation, and emotion — evocatively capture some of the most distinctive aspects of Indian culture, spirituality, arts, and history. His work has been compared with other famed Indian authors, particularly those writing in English (Mulk Raj Anand, R. K. Narayan, Raja Rao). In this interview, Das reflects on his life work, including the role of translation (in an Indian context of “transcreation”). Das also shares his candid views on the poetics and politics of “regional language literature” (RLL) and “Indian writing in English” (IWE), an opposition relevant to postcolonial studies in the context of the (national and international) distribution and reception of literature and the wider politics of language. Conducted in the southern Indian city of Puducherry, home to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, this interview presents the influence of philosopher and guru Sri Aurobindo on Das and his work, including Das’s most recent scholarship on Sri Aurobindo. Das also discusses the influences on him by the well-known Indian writers Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Fakir Mohan Senapati, and Rabindranath Tagore. This is the first interview with Das published outside of India and in the West.","authors":["Manav Ratti"],"journal":"The Journal of Commonwealth Literature","datePublished":"2018-4-13","aiKeywords":["Regional language literature vs. Indian writing in English","Spirituality and philosophy in literature","Indian literature and culture","Human condition and rural life","Postcolonial studies","Influences of prominent Indian authors","Translation and transcreation"],"facultyKeywords":["Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","American literature (United States)","Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics nec","English literature (British and commonwealth)","Spanish language and literature","Philosophy and religious studies nec","Comparative literature","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences","Ethnic studies","Social sciences, other","Philosophy and religious studies","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Social sciences","Linguistics","Social sciences nec","History philosophy of science, technology and society","Area studies","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","English language and literature nec","English language and literature, letters","Philosophy","Romance languages, literatures, and linguistics","Sociology, general","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Religion religious studies","Humanities","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics","Hispanic Latin American languages, literatures, and linguistics","Interdisciplinary computer sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0021989418760975","licenseUrl":"https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license"},{"id":"10.1177/1548051818767392","type":"paper","title":"To Lead Is to Err: The Mediating Role of Attribution in the Relationship Between Leader Error and Leader Ratings","abstract":"The purpose of this study was threefold: to expand the existing leader error taxonomy to include a third dimension of leader error (i.e., ethical errors), to examine the differential effects of error type on leader ratings, and to test a mediated model in which behavioral attribution mediated the relationship between error type and leader ratings.

This mixed-methods approach revealed that language use differs significantly between male and female applicants. Notably, linguistic variables common in female candidates’ writing tend to focus on elaborating ideas and using compare/contrast techniques to describe beliefs. Male applicants’ language is often more formal and relies heavily on passive voice. Our findings raise questions as to whether candidates may be selected because of an unconscious preference for language patterns commonly used by females or males.","authors":["Courtney Preston","Maida A.

Although little is known about the nature of these signaling molecules, evolutionary conservation between hookworms and the model nematodeC. eleganssuggests that hookworm host‐signal receptors are likely to be G‐protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are expressed in amphid neurons. Based on bioinformatic analysis of developmental stage‐specific RNA‐Seq data fromA. caninumandA. ceylanicum, predicted hookworm GPCRs with increased expression levels during the infective larval stage 3 (iL3) were identified.\\n\\nApproximately 1500 bp of genomic sequence upstream of the predicted start site for the putativeA. ceylanicumGPCRs were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence to generate promoter‐GFP transcriptional fusion constructs, which were microinjected intoC. elegans. Of nine hookworm promoter fusions tested, four drove differential GFP expression inC. eleganstissues, including the digestive tract, pharynx, and a neuron pair. Preliminary analysis identified the neurons as interneurons, potentially involved in locomotion responses to chemosensory input inC. elegans. The putative GPCR encoded by the neuronally expressed gene is upregulated in bothA. ceylanicumandA. caninum, suggesting that it may play a general role in hookworm development during host infection. These experiments indicate that hookworm promoters can be expressed inC. elegans, providing a surrogate system for the study of hookworm gene expression patterns.\\n\\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.

However, an unintended consequence of such plans may be to reduce honesty in managerial reporting. We investigate two commonly observed profit sharing plans (individual and pooled) in a laboratory experiment where multiple agents with private cost information submit budget requests to an employer. Consistent with our prediction based on crowding theory, our findings suggest that honesty is reduced in the presence of an individual profit sharing plan. However, when a pooled profit sharing plan is used, the adverse effects on honesty are partially mitigated. Our results suggest that an unintended consequence of profit sharing (decreased honesty) can be mitigated through interdependency from pooled plans. The results have practical implications, given that organizations have flexibility in establishing both the size and scope of their profit sharing plans.

What is justice when its agent is subaltern — disprivileged by both caste and class — and delivers justice to himself? I argue that the fictional representation of class, caste, poverty, and violence can be similar to the structuring and translations of justice. By writing his novel from the perspective of a subaltern character, Adiga joins the call by Dalit critics to reconfigure modernity from the interests of the oppressed and the marginalized. In the process, there can be a rethinking of postcolonial literary criticism from within the postcolonial nation, rather than the established perspective of the postcolonial nation understanding its own colonial oppression. My essay provokes wider insights into the implications for justice and human rights as they are informed and represented by literary fiction, subaltern theory, and deconstructive theory. How can a writer conceive of and represent justice — literary justice — by working within and against philosophical and legal conceptions of justice?

CTML extends stochastic temporal logics in a way that it takes a real value as input and output a real value in the range of[0,∞), as opposed to 0/1 values as input and output, and it cannestreal values. This allows CTML to express a rich set of queries towards the unification of model checking and performance evaluation. In fact, CTML covers PCTL. It can express a nontrivial subset of PLTL formulas that cannot be expressed by PCTL. The significance of this result is that the overall complexity of CTML is linear, as opposed to exponential as it is with PLTL, in the size of the operators for a given formula, and polynomial in the size of a given model. Moreover, CTML can express real-valued performance queries such as: “if a system encounters a failure, what is the expected time to reach a recovery state?” that cannot be expressed by a probabilistic model checking logic, because they are “probabilistic” at most.

These results support the hypothesis that the resource curse, when left unchecked by weak institutions, promotes rent‐seeking behaviour that harms entrepreneurship. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","authors":["Dustin Chambers","Jonathan Munemo"],"journal":"Journal of International Development","datePublished":"2018-10-7","aiKeywords":["Natural Resource Management","Entrepreneurship","Governance Quality","Resource Curse","Rent-Seeking Behavior"],"facultyKeywords":["Public policy analysis, general","Business","Economics, general","Development economics and international development","Business administration and management nec","Environmental natural resource economics","Public policy analysis","Economics","Business administration and management","Political science and government","Political science and government, general","Social sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jid.3397","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1386/ctl.13.3.351_1","type":"paper","title":"Action civics education and civic outcomes for urban youth: An evaluation of the impact of Generation Citizen","abstract":"In action civics education, an emerging promising practice, students learn civics through taking action on a community issue of interest.

The effect of a delay on children's episodic memories of learning new facts","abstract":"Accurately remembering how and when one's own learning occurs is an important metacognitive skill that matures during the early school years. In two studies, the impact of a delay on this ability was examined. In Study 1, 30 children in two age groups (4‐year‐olds and 5‐year‐olds) participated in two‐staged learning events and were interviewed immediately after each event about the facts they had learned in the events and about how they had acquired them. Children in both age groups learned the facts, but had significant difficulty reporting on their own learning. In Study 2, 79 children in the same age range participated in one staged learning event and were given similar interviews as in Study 1, either immediately after the event or after a 2‐ to 3‐day delay. Five‐year‐olds were more accurate in their memories of learning in the delay condition than in the immediate condition, but 4‐year‐olds showed no performance differences as a function of delay. Findings are interpreted in light of developmental literature on episodic memory, source monitoring, and memory binding.\\n\\n## Highlights:\\nHow does a delay interval between impact children's ability to accurately recall episodic memories of their own learning?Children completed staged learning events.

But how exactly can it help students to learn not only about different IR theories, but also about what it means to use a theory in the first place? To address this question, I highlight my experiences overseeing the game during the first 2 weeks of seven introductory IR classes. Drawing from debriefing worksheets that 151 students completed after playing it, I examine whether they (1) made (implicit) connections to various theoretical perspectives and (2) developed a critical appreciation of theoretical abstraction and simplification. I find that the game’s social and collaborative components lend themselves to theories beyond neorealism. More importantly, I show that by modeling rather than replicating world politics, Diplomacy introduces students to a counterintuitive idea: that theories can reveal things about reality even as they distort and omit parts of it. Moreover, having students reflect on the game’s limitations encourages them to fill in the gaps, anticipate topics covered throughout the semester, and recognize the challenges of putting theories into practice.\\n\\nKeywords: Simulations, role playing, participation, negotiation, active learning.\\n\\nAcknowledgments: I thank Carolyn Shaw, Josh Ryan, Kayce Mobley, Kimberly Zagorski, Patrick James, two anonymous reviewers, and the editors of JPSE for their comments and feedback on previous drafts of this article.\\n\\nNotes: 1 For example, I assign International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity, 4th edition, edited by Tim Dunne, Milja Jurki, and Steve Smith as the main textbook, which is entirely organized around different theoretical perspectives. Two other major introductory IR textbooks include International Politics: Power and Purpose in Global Affairs, by Paul D’Anieri, which devotes a main section to “theoretical approaches” and International Relations, by Joshua Goldstein and Jon C. Pevehouse, which covers “realist theories” and “liberal and social theories.” 2 I used an online version of the game, which allowed me to display the game board via the projector during class and allowed students to continue playing outside of class. See Arnold (2015) for extremely helpful instructions on setting up the game using this online platform. 3 More specifically, 70% of the first Fall Semester 2015 class, 56% of the second Fall Semester 2015 class, 85% of the Spring Semester 2016 class, 79% of the Fall Semester 2016 class, 76% of the Fall Semester 2017 class, 85% of the first Spring Semester 2018 class, and 88% of the second Spring Semester 2018 class participated in this study. 4 I confronted that question of whether a theory primes students to approach simulations in particular ways during two prisoner’s dilemma simulations. I administered the first of these simulations after covering neorealism; students thus had an idea of how they were expected to respond to the dilemma. They were presented, however, with the prospect of earning bonus points for defying those expectations. In some cases they did; in others they did not. I administered the second simulation after covering neoliberalism, and so I altered it from a one-round to an iterative, multiround prisoner’s dilemma. I was curious to see whether students would take the insights of neoliberalism to heart, account for the “shadow of the future,” and maximize their bonus points through ongoing, mutual cooperation. Or, would they seek vengeance for betrayals that might have occurred in the previous simulations and disregard the opportunity costs (i.e., giving up more bonus points) through a surprise defection? Going with the latter would segue into our next unit on constructivism, given its focus on norms and norm-enforcement. Again, different classes yielded different results. But when students upended theoretical expectations, they reinforced lessons about how the partiality of theories actually calls attention to their omissions and distortions. 5 These 46 students were those who both allowed me to use their debriefing worksheets and gave me permission—per IRB requirements—to use their midterm essays in this study.\\n\\nAdditional information:\\n\\nNotes on contributors: Eric R.

Over the course of a long and successful career, however, quality physical education teachers must continue to adapt to the changing demands of their profession. The professional growth that results in the development of quality physical education teachers begins with their entry into the undergraduate professional education program, continues with their initial employment, and matures over the course of their professional career. Physical education teacher education programs provide experiences that lay the foundation for continued professional development and learning over the span of a professional teaching career. The purpose of this article is to share a descriptive model of sequential professional growth and examples of developmental activities that can be integrated into a teacher education program to facilitate this growth. The professional growth and development activities are described within the context of the following four stages: (1) awareness stage, (2) exploration stage, (3) connection stage, and (4) professional stage.

Women in developing countries are 33 times more likely to die from preventable maternal-related causes compared with those in developed countries (WHO, Citation2017). Ninety-nine percent of maternal deaths occur in developing countries—one-fifth of which occur in India (WHO, Citation2016). The MMR (maternal mortality rate per 100,000 women) reflects the challenges of bridging the gendered health inequity of access and exclusion.\\n\\n2. ACHA’s mandate involves the detection of conditions (e.g., maternal anemia) and management of high-risk pregnancies including direct obstetric causes of maternal mortality (e.g., postpartum hemorrhage, obstructed labor, DMCH, Citation2005).\\n\\n3. The Delhi Development Authority identifies unplanned colonies as: urbanized village, jhuggi jhoppari (J.J.) clusters, J.J. resettlement, slum rehabilitation, unauthorized, and regularized-unauthorized colonies (Government of Delhi, Citationn.d.).\\n\\n4. Policy reports identify factors such as threat to female modesty, caste discrimination, and cost as influencing access to healthcare facilities by migrant women and their families. The Sample Registration System that tracks Millennium Development Goals (United Nations UN, Citation2015) on child mortality and maternal health finds that Delhi, with high rural–urban migration, has the highest MMR (> 300; Office of Registrar General, Government of India, Citation2011).\\n\\n5.

To balance Vata, herbs and food appropriate to each month of the pregnancy are eaten per specific rules (e.g., not eating pungent food).","authors":["Vinita Agarwal"],"journal":"Health Communication","datePublished":"2017-2-3","aiKeywords":["Critique of knowledge production","Gendered health inequities","Cultural implications for maternal health","Consciousness-raising and collective narratives","Maternal knowledge and experiences","Post-structuralist feminist analysis","Integrative construction of care"],"facultyKeywords":["Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","Nursing science","Environmental health","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences","Health sciences","Ethnic studies","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Social sciences","History philosophy of science, technology and society","Area studies","Nursing specialties and practice","Nursing and nursing science","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Sociology, general","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Public health, general","Public health","Interdisciplinary computer sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2016.1278492","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1080/10696679.2016.1270767","type":"paper","title":"Decision Making Under Parity: An Experimental Examination of Retailers’ Choice Among Parity Trade Promotions","abstract":"## Abstract\\nRetailers tend to choose trade promotions that offer the greatest short-term economic benefit.

Undergraduate men (n = 385) completed the Rape-Perpetrator Empathy Scale (Smith and Frieze 2003) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Perpetration (Koss et al. 2007), which first asks behavior-based questions, without using the word “rape,” to identify rapists and those with other sexual perpetration experience, and then asks if they “may have ever raped someone.” None of the respondents admitted to “rape,” but participants whose survey responses indicated prior behavior consistent with rape (rapists) reported greater empathy than those who indicated no behaviors consistent with any type of sexual perpetration (nonperpetrators). Respondents who indicated prior behavior consistent with sexual perpetration, but not rape (nonrape perpetrators) did not differ from either rapists or nonperpetrators. Committing rape may be associated with greater rape perpetrator empathy due to similarity in experience.","authors":["Suzanne L. Osman","Ruby L.

Despite an ethical mandate to advocate for social and economic justice, there is a retrenching emphasis on macro practice within social work education. This circumstance affects the profession’s commitment to human rights and social justice as social work students are often unable to actively engage in change-making activities. Many students graduate without the knowledge and skills needed to enact systemic change in their agencies, communities, states, or nation. This case study will explore the use of experiential learning methods to challenge carceral power through the demonstration of macro practice skills, which are essential for challenging the status quo of practices and policies that sustain oppressive systems. This case study details the organization and facilitation of ‘Know Your Rights’ (KYR) trainings, which educate community members about their Constitutional rights when confronted by the police. Through a successful collaboration between the American Civil Liberties Union, a social work program, and a dozen community organizations, the KYR trainings, conducted by over 60 BSW students engaged in three macro practice courses, were delivered in a rural community on the east coast with nearly 400 community members and students in attendance.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Social justice, experiential learning, macro social work practice","authors":["Jennifer R.

Studying responses to oxidative stress in model organisms, like the nematode wormCaenorhabditis elegans, may provide insight into basic underlying cellular mechanisms shared with humans. MRCK‐1 (myotonic dystrophy kinase‐related Cdc42 binding kinase), a highly conserved intracellular kinase, is activated by the G‐protein, Cdc42, which contains a redox sensitive motif. Previous studies have shown that MRCK‐1 regulates cell polarity and cytoskeleton reorganization, particularly during cell division and in response to cellular damage. To determine if MRCK‐1 plays a role in other cellular defense responses, we are testing if RNA interference (RNAi) ofmrck‐1results in the production of more ROS under stressed conditions. The cell permeable fluorescent ROS indicator, carboxymethyl dichlorodihydrofluorescein derivative, CM‐H2DCFDA, shows significantly increased fluorescence in hydrogen peroxide‐treated worms when quantified using the SpectraMax microplate reader. Oxidative stress conditions were induced with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of CM‐H2DCFDA, and fluorescence was measured over a period of 20 hours. Measuring the fluorescence of worms exposed to dsRNA from two independentmrck‐1RNAi constructs,mrck‐mandmrck‐s, enables the quantification of ROS levels when MRCK‐1 function is decreased. Exploring the levels of ROS in RNAi‐treatedC. elegansmay give further insight into the cellular role of MRCK‐1 both in worms and in humans.\\n\\nSupport or Funding Information\\n\\nSpecial acknowledgments to the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Henson Undergraduate Research Award, and the National Science Foundation MRI Acquisition Award DBI‐1337534 for support.","authors":["Patti Erickson","Matthew Russo","Stephen Rigoulot","Callista Brown","Ruth Heying"],"journal":"The FASEB Journal","datePublished":"2018-10-3","aiKeywords":["Neurodegenerative diseases","Model organisms in biomedical research","Reactive oxygen species (ROS)","Oxidative stress","Cellular defense mechanisms","Role of MRCK-1 in cellular processes"],"facultyKeywords":["Medical clinical science","Biological and biomedical sciences","Health sciences, general","Environmental health","Molecular genetics","Health sciences, other","Neuroscience","Health sciences","Neurobiology and neurosciences","Human medical genetics","Cognitive neuroscience","Mental health, counseling, and therapy services and sciences","Biochemistry and molecular biology","Biochemistry","Molecular biology","Genetics and genomics","Public health, general","Genetics, general","Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology","Public health","Neurobiology and anatomy"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.31.1_supplement.770.10","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1096/fasebj.31.1_supplement.943.4","type":"paper","title":"Isolation, Identification, and Characterization of Local Wild Yeasts for Use In Fermentation","abstract":"Inspired by spontaneously fermented beers, such as Belgian Lambic beers, American breweries have moved beyond using exclusively domesticated strains of the beer‐making yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to experimenting with a variety of different yeast species to produce unique flavors and aromas. The so‐called “funky,” “wild,” and “sour,” beers are produced using uncommon microorganisms either during or after the primary ferment. The goal of our research is to isolate, identify, and characterize wild yeasts from the local environment and to make them available to both commercial and craft brewers for making novel beers. The use of locally‐sourced yeasts could also be used by commercial brewers as a marketing angle, as is often done with local hops, grains, or water. As a source of wild yeasts, we obtained various wild and cultivated fruits growing in rural Maryland and a sample of Belgium‐style ale being aged in used oak wine barrels at Evolution Craft Brewing Company (Salisbury, MD). Yeast colonies were isolated using yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) agar plates containing antibiotics and identified by colony morphology as well as PCR amplification and sequencing of the 5.8S rRNA genes. The identified yeasts belong toSaccharomyces,Pichia,Candida, Fusarium,Torulaspora,and, most interestingly,Brettanomycesgenera. TheBrettanomycesyeast, which was isolated from the wine barrel ale, is normally considered a wine spoilage yeast but increasingly is being employed to create “funky” and sour flavors in beer. The growth and fermentation abilities of eight different yeast isolates were analyzed for growth in different liquid medias (YPD, hopped barley‐malt extract, and merlot grape juice) using 96‐well plates and spectroscopy. Growth rates were calculated using a modified grofit package in RStudio. Ethanol production will be determined using a colorimetric assay. Thus far, the most compelling discovery is a wild strain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaethat grows comparable to a commercially‐available brewing yeast and produces pleasant, fruity aromas when fermenting barley malt extract. The complete characterization of these wild yeasts will be reported in order to identify novel wild yeasts that can be domesticated for local craft brewers.\\n\\nSupport or Funding Information\\n\\nSpecial acknowledgments to the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Henson Undergraduate Research Award, Evolution Craft Brewery, and the National Science Foundation for funding and equipment, as well as Dr. Philip D.

Ligation of the small peptide ubiquitin (Ub) onto substrate proteins by E3 Ub ligases can change protein localization, activity or stability. The most common outcome for Ub‐tagged proteins is degradation via the 26S proteasome. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) reverse the effects of ubiquitination by removing Ub from tagged substrates. In animals, Ubiquitin‐specific protease (USP) 12 and USP46 are related DUBs that regulate key proteins in important growth and differentiation signaling pathways. USP12 and USP46 each form trimeric complexes with two WD‐repeat (WDR) proteins, WDR20 and WDR48. The WDR proteins activate the enzymatic abilities of the DUBs while potentially serving as substrate receptors. Numerous animal and fungal DUBs are bound and activated by specific WDR proteins. InArabidopsis, Ub‐specific proteases 3 (AtUBP3) and 4 (AtUBP4) are related DUBs that have significant sequence similarities to animal USP12/46. Genetic studies have shown AtUBP3/4 are essential for proper pollen development and transmission. It is not yet known if WDR proteins bind and activate DUBs in plants. We have identified At2g37160 as a likelyArabidopsisWDR20 homolog based on amino acid sequence homology and the number and organization of WD motifs. We have shown At2g37160 (AtWDR20) interacts with both AtUBP3 and AtUBP4 in the yeast two‐hybrid system. Biochemical characterization using recombinant proteins shows AtWDR20 increases the DUB activity of AtUBP3 over nine‐fold. A yeast two‐hybrid screen of anArabidopsiscDNA library using AtWDR20 as bait revealed interactions between AtWDR20 and two different E3 Ub ligases: Myb‐30 Interacting E3 Ub ligase (MIEL1) and CHY Zinc‐finger and Ring Protein 1 (CHYR1). Interactions between a DUB‐associated WDR protein and E3 Ub ligases is intriguing, and implies AtWDR20 may function on both sides of the Ub cycle or is itself a target of ubiquitination.In plantaandin vitroanalyses will further characterize the interactions between AtWDR20, AtUBP3, and these E3 ligases.","authors":["Glenda Gillaspy","Andrew T Baskerville","Janet Donahue","Les Erickson"],"journal":"The FASEB Journal","datePublished":"2018-10-3","aiKeywords":["Ubiquitination and its regulatory mechanisms","Importance of ubiquitin cycle in plant development","Interaction between deubiquitinases and WD-repeat proteins","Role of deubiquitinases in cellular processes"],"facultyKeywords":["Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Plant sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Cell cellular biology and anatomy","Genetics and genomics","Biochemistry and molecular biology","Genetics, general","Biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology","Developmental biology and embryology","Biochemistry","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences nec","Cell cellular and molecular biology","Molecular biology","Molecular genetics","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.31.1_supplement.lb102","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1080/00098655.2017.1301155","type":"paper","title":"Classroom Data Analysis with the Five Strands of Mathematical Proficiency","abstract":"Qualitative classroom data from video recordings and students' written work can play important roles in improving mathematics instruction.

Here I determine where and what earthworm species commonly occur in my study area, and compare effects of native and invasive earthworms on the common woodland salamander,Plethodon cinereus, in field surveys and laboratory experiments. The native earthwormEisenoides carolinensiswas the most common earthworm, followed by two invasive speciesDendrobaena octaedraandOctolasion tyrtaeum. The presence ofO. tyrtaeumwas associated with a narrower O‐horizon (i.e., organic layer in the soil). Using structural equation modeling to explore direct and indirect pathways of these three most common earthworm species on salamanders, I foundO. tyrtaeumoccurrence was negatively correlated with nighttime salamander counts, a proxy for total salamander numbers, mediated by negative effects on O‐horizon depth and microinvertebrate numbers. In the laboratory,O. tyrtaeumandD. octaedraconsumed more leaf litter per gram of earthworm per day than the nativeE. carolinensis. However, salamanders consumed earthworms and used burrows of all native and invasive species of earthworms similarly. The potential for negative indirect effects of the invasive earthwormO. tyrtaeumonP. cinereuswas demonstrated both in the field and laboratory, highlighting that seemingly small differences between native and invasive ecosystem engineers have the potential to significantly alter the effects of these closely related native and invasive organisms.","authors":["Tami S.

We concluded that editorials might hold increased weight in spurring change, as the percentage of smokers in a city is unrelated to the town enacting a clean indoor air ordinance.","authors":["Kellie Stanfield","Shelly Rodgers"],"journal":"Health Communication","datePublished":"2017-5-3","aiKeywords":["Health Communication","Community Characteristics and Health Policy","Editorial Tone and Slant in Communication","Influence of Media on Public Policy","Tobacco Control"],"facultyKeywords":["Public policy analysis, general","Social sciences","Health sciences","Public health, general","Public policy analysis","Health policy analysis","Public health","Environmental health","Sociology, general","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2017.1315679","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1177/0146167217699583","type":"paper","title":"Humor Use Moderates the Relation of Stressful Life Events With Psychological Distress","abstract":"Three studies examined humor and adjustment to stressful events. In Study 1, patients with fibromyalgia syndrome ( N = 22) reported on mental and physical adjustment, social interaction, and reappraisal of their illness. Dispositional humor was associated with reduced distress and fewer physical symptoms. Study 2 ( N = 109) examined undergraduates’ reports of stressful events. Dispositional, self-enhancing, affiliative, and self-defeating humor showed direct effects on distress, which were mediated by social interaction and reappraisal. Moreover, dispositional and aggressive humor showed stress-buffering effects. Study 3 ( N = 105) examined undergraduates’ adjustment to the September 11, 2001, attacks at 1 and 3 months postattack. At T1, affiliative humor showed a stress-buffering effect on distress. Social interaction mediated the relation of self-enhancing humor with reduced T1 distress, and mediated relations of aggressive and self-defeating humor with greater distress. Relations of T1 dispositional and self-defeating humor to changes in T2 distress were mediated by reappraisal.","authors":["Melissa M. Dillon","Heidi L. Fritz","Leslie N.

J.; Brandriet, A. R.; Holme, T. A. J. Chem. Educ.2017, 94, 3–10) about characterization of the presence of scientific practices in assessment items. We want to clarify and encourage the use of the 3D-LAP in its published form. For example, in the 3D-LAP, we claim that a question can only elicit evidence of the practice Developing and Using Models if it has all of the following features, the last being most important in our view: (1) Question gives an event, observation, or phenomenon for the student to explain or make a prediction about. (2) Question gives a representation or asks student to construct a representation. (3) Question asks student to explain or make a prediction about the event, observation, or phenomenon. (4) Question asks student to provide the reasoning that links the representation to their explanation or prediction. We find that the reasoning component is most often absent from the typical assessment tasks that we ask of students, and it is this component that was missing in our earlier version of the protocol which provided an “implicit” characterization of assessment items. Finally, we caution that the presence of a representation does not necessarily engage students in the practice of modeling. We are encouraged by the interest of our research community in developing, using, and analyzing assessments that engage students in scientific practices; we look forward to continuing this work together.","authors":["Sarah E.

Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, are often used as indicators of habitat quality in eastern North American forests. Most of the research concerning growth in this species has focused on the influence of body size, rather than on other external or temporal factors that might affect growth. We performed a mark–recapture study spanning multiple years and seasons to compare the growth of individuals of P. cinereus across temporally variable environmental conditions. Unsurprisingly, the most significant factor affecting growth was body size. Growth also varied seasonally and annually, with greater growth of salamanders during a mild winter and more growth in 2014 than 2013. Sex-age class did interact with yearly fluctuations as evidenced by juveniles, but not adults, having reduced growth in 2014. However, color morph did not have an effect on growth. We concluded that fluctuating environmental conditions, as well as body size, exerted effects on the salamanders' growth. This study adds to our understanding of the factors affecting growth in terrestrial salamanders and provides context for past and future studies of body size and abundance in this ecologically important species.","authors":["Joshua R.

Based on a paired sample of 161 legal secretaries and their managers, results indicated that managers used the attitudes and behaviors displayed by employees (strong extra-role performance and enhanced work engagement) as cues from which to base their perceptions of employees’ affective commitment to the organization. In turn, employees perceived as highly committed to the organization experienced enhanced content and structural career growth opportunities. Moreover, the relation between managers’ perceptions of employees’ organizational commitment and content career growth opportunities was stronger for employees perceived as also highly committed to their careers than for employees perceived as less committed to their careers.","authors":["Christy H.

Examining the grammar of visuality in which typographic choice, toponymic-allusion, punctuational detail, as well as onomastics and embedded speech acts emerge ripe in literal and metaphoric meaning, the paper demonstrates how acts of intertextual chaining of political history and candidate biography re-affirm the need for interpretive frameworks which are dynamic – not static – and which are simultaneously incorporative of exophoric text-context accounts of witnessed signage. The in-built potential of campaign yard signage in triggering contagious and conspicuous acts of affective stance-taking particularly in neighborhoods of geospatial contiguity are examined both for how they fit into LL research, as well as for how they prod further innovation in its interdisciplinary-inspired and evolving frameworks of analysis.","authors":["Anjali Pandey"],"journal":"Linguistic Landscape.

Colocating social care and medical care services in the primary care office would expand the availability of shallow end services, allow for triaging of concerns and the reduction of wait times for initial screening and assessment services. The Maryland Behavioral Health Integration in Pediatric Primary Care colocated model involves collaborations between primary care providers and master’s-level social work interns to enhance behavioral health outcomes for children and families in rural Maryland. Findings from the first three years’ program evaluations provide much valuable information about challenges to program success and utilization. Some of the findings indicate that the primary care providers’ understanding of the social work identity in a colocated context affects how often the interns are asked to consult and how they are perceived by families. Feedback from the interns indicates that feelings of isolation as social workers in the host environments affects their experiences in the field placement and with the families.

Universities (most notably Stanford), venture capital and law firms acted as magnets for divisions of established firms and local start-ups. These institutions combined with the Santa Clara County’s available land to pull the high-tech region’s epicentre south-eastwards from San Francisco, an early source of investment capital and legal expertise. These findings add another element (spatial change) for consideration in explaining the evolution of industry clusters.\\n\\nKeywords: High-tech clusters, industrial location, geography, regional Silicon Valley\\n\\nNotes\\n1.

The pigeon flocculus receives visual‐optokinetic information and is important for generating compensatory eye movements. It consists of 4 sagittal zones based on PC complex spike activity (CSA) in response to rotational optokinetic stimuli. There are two zones where CSA responds best to rotation about the vertical axis (VA), interdigitated with two zones where CSA responds best to rotation about an horizontal axis (HA). These optokinetic zones relate to the ZII stripes in folium IXcd of the flocculus, such that an optokinetic zone spans a ZII+/− pair: the HA zones span the P5+/− and P7+/− ZII stripe pairs, whereas the VA zones correspond to ZII stripe pairs P4+/− and P6+/−. In the present study, we used fluorescent retrograde tracing to determine the olivary inputs to the ZII+ and ZII− stripes within the functional pairs. We found that separate but adjacent areas of the medial column of the inferior olive (mcIO) project to the ZII+ and ZII− stripes within each of the functional pairs. Thus, although a ZII+/− stripe pair represents a functional unit in the pigeon flocculus insofar as the CSA of all PCs in the stripe pair encodes similar sensory information, the olivary inputs to the ZII+ and ZII− stripes arise from different, although adjacent, regions of the mcIO.","authors":["Jeremy R.

The themes describe preventive care by identifying how CAM providers negotiate their relational positionality in connecting with clients, structural positionality within the field of health care, and philosophical positionality within the ontological understandings that guide how health is defined and conceptualized.

Regulatory focus, social exchange, and marketing relationship theories explain the online consumer personal information share-and-protect model developed. Consumers aged 18–64 years across the United States participated in this survey research. The results suggest that while personal privacy violation experience and perceived secondary control of one's personal information are influential antecedents, privacy concerns and trust in social media websites mediate each of these respectively. The findings suggest that promotion- and prevention-related behaviors regarding personal information align with the orientation of the antecedents, indicating that regulatory focus theory shows promise for examining the privacy paradox.

Findings show the intertwined roles of economic capital, social capital, cultural capital and symbolic capital with co-cultural communication orientations, when interacting with members of the majority group. Particularly, findings reveal differences between Korean husbands and immigrant wives. For Korean husbands, economic and social capital are the most critical influential factors in their choices of communication orientations, while for immigrant wives, cultural and symbolic capital are most significant. Additionally, contrary to previous research, Confucianism and patriarchy played key roles in the marginalization of Korean men in multicultural families and influenced their co-cultural communication orientations.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: Co-cultural theory, Bourdieu, capital, multicultural families, immigrant women\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors would like to thank to Dr Jeanne McPherson, Dr Joe Miller, and Dr Masahiro Yamamoto who provided thoughtful comments on the very first draft of this manuscript as well as three anonymous reviewers.\\n\\nNotes\\n* An earlier version of this manuscript was presented to the annual meeting of the NCA (National Communication Association), Las Vegas, 2015.\\n1. Cho-Seon-Jok (조선족) is the term used by mainstream Chinese to refer to Koreans as one of many ethnic minorities in mainland China. In Korea, the term Cho-Seon-Jok (조선족) refers to ethnic Koreans from China. Because we find this terminology problematic and supportive of systems of othering, we use the term “ethnic Koreans from China,” or EKC. The EKC women in this study referred to themselves as “people from China” (중국에서 온 사람들).\\n2. Multicultural Family (Da-Mun-Hwa-Ga-Jok ; 다문화가족) in Korea refers to any family which consists of a native Korean citizen, his/her non-native Korean spouse who obtained Korean citizenship through marriage immigration, and their offspring (Lee, Citation2010). Several different terms are used interchangeably, but multicultural family (Da-Mun-Hwa-Ga-Jok; 다문화가족) is the most commonly used term in Korea.\\n3. Gye (계) is a traditional private trust fund where members deposit a small amount of money on a monthly basis, and take turns withdrawing a lump sum share. In addition to financially helping each other the Gye (계) is a social network, particularly for people in rural communities who do not have professional networks. Gye (계) in Korean society is similar to the “Hui” (Sandel, Citation2000, p. 81) in Taiwan.

We also explore the conditions under which teams rely on perceived expertise versus social status in determining influence relationships in teams. To do so, we present a contingency model in which the salience of expertise and social status depends on the types of intragroup conflicts. Using multiwave survey data from 50 student project teams with 320 members at a large national research institute located in South Korea, we found that both actual expertise and social status had direct and indirect effects on member influence through perceived expertise. Furthermore, perceived expertise at the early stage of team projects is driven by social status, whereas perceived expertise at the later stage of a team project is mainly driven by actual expertise. Finally, we found that members who are being perceived as experts are more influential when task conflict is high or when relationship conflict is low. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.","authors":["Woonki Hong","Lu Zhang","Kwangwook Gang","Boreum Choi"],"journal":"Group &amp; Organization Management","datePublished":"2017-9-6","aiKeywords":["Perceived expertise","Influence of expertise","Conflict resolution in teams","Team dynamics","Social status in teams"],"facultyKeywords":["Social sciences nec","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences nec","Interdisciplinary computer sciences nec","Behavioral and cognitive sciences","Social sciences, other","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences, other","Psychology","Research and experimental psychology","Social psychology","Research and experimental psychology nec","Interdisciplinary computer sciences","Multidisciplinary interdisciplinary sciences","Sociology, general","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Social sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1059601117728145","licenseUrl":"https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license"},{"id":"10.1002/2017jd026911","type":"paper","title":"The Saharan Air Layer as an Early Rainfall Season Suppressant in the Eastern Caribbean: The 2015 Puerto Rico Drought","abstract":"Eastern Puerto Rico and the surrounding Caribbean experienced a severe drought in 2015 that resulted in record‐low reservoir and river levels. Rainfall deficits in April and May, which represent the period when the drought began, were more severe in 2015 than recent droughts of record. While El Niño has been associated with drought in the Caribbean, onset of the 2015 drought was strongly associated with lower‐than‐average values of a recently developed tool used by weather forecasters in San Juan, the Gálvez‐Davison Index (GDI), which is used to measure the potential for thunderstorm development and rainfall. Persistently low GDI values indicate strong and frequent intrusions of hot, dry air in the low to middle troposphere, suppressing convection, both locally and in development regions for tropical waves that impact Puerto Rico. The Saharan Air Layer (SAL) is largely responsible for this anomalously hot, dry air, which produced thermodynamically stable conditions and limited thunderstorms and rainfall. Moreover, higher‐than‐normal aerosol concentrations, typically associated with SAL intrusion over the Caribbean, were recorded in April and May 2015. A comparison to advanced very high resolution radiometer aerosol optical thickness demonstrates that higher Caribbean aerosols in the early rainfall season, particularly June, are associated with decreased rainfall in eastern Puerto Rico. Results here demonstrate a direct link between the early and more pronounced SAL intrusions into the Caribbean and the suppression of the early rainfall season. More broadly, a reduction in the GDI and increase in the trade wind inversion was associated with reduced early season rainfall in the eastern Caribbean.","authors":["Paul W. Miller","Thomas L.

While these preferences have been well studied, their evolutionary origins remain unclear. We tested whether females gain a fitness benefit by mating with leading males inNeoconocephalus ensigerkatydids. We mated leading and following males with random females and measured the number and quality ofF1, the number ofF2and the heritability of the preferred male trait. We found that females mating with leaders and followers did not differ in the number ofF1orF2offspring. Females mating with leading males had offspring that were in better condition than those mating with following males suggesting a benefit in the form of higher quality offspring. We found no evidence that the male trait, the production of leading calls, was heritable. This suggests that there is no genetic correlate for the production of leading calls and that the fitness benefit gained by females must be a direct benefit, potentially mediated by seminal proteins. The presence of benefits indicates that leader preference is adaptive inN. ensiger, which may explain the evolutionary origin of leader preference; further tests are required to determine whether fitness benefits can explain the phylogenetic distribution of leader preference inNeoconocephalus. The absence of heritability will prevent leader preference from becoming coupled with or exaggerating the male trait and prevent females from gaining a ‘sexy‐sons’ benefit, weakening the overall selection for leader preference.","authors":["M.

Using a large data set with 115,899 records of ad tap-through from a mobile advertising company in China, the authors identify that the influencing factors for advertisement tap through are application type, mobile operators, scrolling frequency, and regional income level. They use a logit model to analyze how the probability of advertisement tap through is related to the identified factors. The results show that application type, mobile operators, scrolling frequency, and the regional income level are positively correlated with the likelihood whether users would tap on certain types of advertising. In addition, they use the Bayesian network model to estimate the conditional probability for a user to tap on an advertisement in an application after the user already taps on another advertisement in the same application.

After defining and conceptualizing mental illness as a social identity, we systematically review the existing empirical research on employees with mental illness across multiple fields of study. Using research that accounts for individual, other, and organizational perspectives, we present a model that outlines the performance, employment, career, and discriminatory outcomes that characterize the experiences of individuals with mental illness as well as individual and organizational strategies that moderate the relationship between having a mental illness and experiencing those outcomes.

We argue that purification practices can be understood as identity work, the outcome of which is often not an etymologically “purer” language but a (perceived) “purer” and more “authentic” identity. We show that top-down standardization in Tatar has resulted in more homogenized ideologies regarding “pure” language and “authentic” identity, compared to the more heterogeneous ideologies among Iranian Azerbaijanis. Furthermore, we argue that since these communities rarely use the written form of their languages in off-line contexts, their purification practices are profoundly limited to metapragmatic discourses; however, social media provides a unique venue to also exercise these ideologies linguistically/semiotically. Finally, unlike previous scholarship that has focused on the informality of language use on social media, we illustrate how social media turns out to be a platform to practice formal language.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: Azerbaijani/Azerilanguage and identitylanguage ideologieslinguistic purism/purificationsocial mediaTatar\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe would like to thank Rakesh Bhatt, Lydia Catedral, and Kate Lyons for their helpful comments on the initial draft of this paper.

Precipitation is a key driver of the productivity of these sensitive ecosystems. This study analyses historical precipitation variability from 1985 to 2014 at El Verde Field Station (EVFS) at 380 m on the north facing slope of the LM. The primary objective of this study is to identify atmospheric states that lead to extreme wet/dry conditions at EVFS. This study also investigates how those wet/dry atmospheric states change over the study period through an epoch approach on annual and seasonal timescales.\\n\\nSelf‐organizing maps (SOMs) are used to produce atmospheric states from ERA‐Interim low‐tropospheric moisture and circulation variables. These atmospheric states are downscaled to precipitation at the EVFS rain gauge. A probability density function of observed precipitation is calculated for each atmospheric state. Changes in node frequency, which is the number of days mapping to a particular node compared to the total number of days in the temporal period, are used to evaluate changes in wet/dry atmospheric states at EVFS.\\n\\nResults indicate that low‐precipitation days at EVFS are associated with atmospheric states with high 1000–700 hPa bulk wind shear and decreased 700 hPa moisture. Wet days in the study region are associated with moist low‐tropospheric environments with low wind shear. Our results indicate an increased frequency of dry season atmospheric states with lower 700 hPa moisture. Over the study period, the dry season has a decrease in median and extreme precipitation during rainy days (days >0 mm). A decrease in early rainfall season median precipitation on rainy days is observed despite an increase in days with measurable precipitation, likely driven by an increase in light rainfall days (<5 mm).","authors":["Thomas L.

Student completion of a stress management unit including mindfulness and application activities focused on paying attention and living in the present did not result in improved mindfulness. The extent that instructors covered mindfulness in the lab portion of the course, as well as potentially higher stress levels at the end of the semester, may be factors associated with lower post-course mindfulness. These results, combined with previous research showing mindfulness-based programs to be effective in stress reduction, support the need to directly educate students about mindfulness.

Our purpose was to determine the feasibility of utilizing web-based surveys to capture rehabilitation compliance and clinical outcomes among postoperative orthopedic patients. The study hypotheses were that (a) recruitment rate would be high (>90%), (b) patients receiving surveys every two weeks would demonstrate higher response rates than patients that receive surveys every four weeks, and (c) response rates would decrease over time.\\n\\n## Methods:\\nThe study deaign involved a longitudinal cohort. Surgical knee patients were recruited for study participation during their first post-operative visit ( n = 59, 34.9 ± 12.0 years of age). Patients with Internet access, an available email address and willingness to participate were counter-balanced into groups to receive surveys either every two or four weeks for 24 weeks post-surgery. The surveys included questions related to rehabilitation and questions from standard patient-reported outcome measures. Outcome measures included recruitment rate (participants consented/patients approached), eligibility (participants with email/participants consented), willingness (willing participants/participants eligible), and response rate (percentage of surveys completed by willing participants).\\n\\n## Results:\\nFifty-nine patients were approached regarding participation. Recruitment rate was 98% ( n = 58). Eligibility was 95% ( n = 55), and willingness was 91% ( n = 50). The average response rate was 42% across both groups. There was no difference in the median response rates between the two-week (50%, range 0–100%) and four-week groups (33%, range 0–100%; p = 0.55).\\n\\n## Conclusions:\\nAlthough patients report being willing and able to participate in a web-based survey, response rates failed to exceed 50% in both the two-week and four-week groups.

The crux of this issue relates to the charge that many new-generation faculty have a primary focus on academic research, but lack significant practical experience or certification, and the related claim that students may lack the requisite skills upon graduation. This study addresses these concerns by examining the incidence and trend in the possession of practice credentials, experience, and other activities among accounting faculty who graduated between 1994 and 2013. We evaluate how differences in institutional focus, possession of a practice credential, and proportion of credentialed faculty manifest in research propensities, current business experience, and student performance on the CPA exam. We identify a downward trend in practice credential possession that is more pronounced at research-oriented institutions. We further find significant differences in experience and publication activity across levels of both institutional focus and possession of a practice credential. We also find that students from research-oriented universities, schools with separate AACSB accounting accreditation, and those with a higher percentage credentialed faculty perform better on the CPA exam.

Previous research has shown that inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Duf1 interacts with Ubp9 and Ubp13, DUBs involved in the biosynthesis of mitochondrial subunits necessary for respiration. When a DUF1 mutant strain was grown at a higher temperature on a non‐fermentable carbon source, increased petite colony formation was observed. Thus, we hypothesize that Duf1 enhances the yeast's ability to cope with stress. Our interest lies in determining which cellular stress pathways require Duf1 in order to gain insight about its function. By exposing aDUF1knockout mutant strain to different stress conditions and comparing its growth to the wild type parent strain, phenotypes may be revealed to provide a better understanding of the cellular activities of Duf1. Cell growth experiments were performed in 96‐well plates using a Spectramax i3 plate reader and cell number was plotted against time. Growth rate and maximum cell number were computed in R and differences between the knockout mutant and the wild type parent strain were determined using a pairwise Mann‐Whitney U test. When grown in minimal media, the knockout mutant strain grew faster than the wild type parent strain. The knockout mutant was also able to reach a larger maximum cell number than that of the wild type parent strain in minimal media containing high levels of glucose, a stressful growth situation. Conversely, the wild type parent strain grew better when minimal media was supplemented with high amounts of ethanol. This implies that the action of Duf1 as either a positive or negative regulator is dependent upon the type of stress experienced and thatDUF1may play a role in multiple cellular stress response pathways.\\n\\nSupport or Funding Information\\n\\nThis project is supported by an NSF Major Research Instrumentation grant and Salisbury University's Henson Undergraduate Research Fund.","authors":["F.

TheArabidopsis thalianalateral root stimulator 1 (LRS1) gene encodes a Damaged DNA Binding WD40‐repeat (DWD) protein that may play a role in ubiquination regulation. The DWD motif suggests an interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases, but recent findings indicate that LRS1 may regulate deubiquitinases (DUBs), which reverse ubiquitination via cleavage of the bond between ubiquitin and its target protein. LRS1 is highly conserved among eukaryotic species, including humans, worms, and yeast, where it is involved in DNA repair, glutamate receptor abundance, and biosynthesis of mitochondrial subunits necessary for respiration. To determine its biological function in plants, T‐DNA insertion mutants ofLRS1have been identified. Initial observations of thelrs1‐1allele revealed reduced lateral root growth with otherwise normal development. A second allele,lrs1‐2, has been identified and genotyped using PCR. Homozygouslrs1‐2 mutants and their sibling, wild‐type segregants have been isolated after multiple rounds of back‐crossing mutants to the parental wild type Columbia (Col‐0). Both mutant lines are being analyzed for altered developmental and biological phenotypes, including germination rates, sensitivity to auxin and its transport, and reproductive capacity.lrs1mutants are also being grown on media containing phenanthroline, isopropyl (N‐3‐chloro‐phenyl)‐carbamate, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid becauseSaccharomyces cerevisiaemutants lacking theLRS1homolog, DUB‐associated factor 1 (DUF1), are sensitive to these compounds.

Numerous studies have shown that acute exposure to periods of high shear stress; whether by exercise or heating, results in increased conduit artery flow‐mediated vasodilation immediately following exposure. However, it is unknown if these transient increases in conduit artery vascular function are sufficient to improve the matching of oxygen supply and demand distal to the site of stenosis in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that a single bout of lower limb heating (for 15 or 45 minutes) increases resting popliteal artery blood flow and 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) in patients with PAD. One 71 year old male patient with PAD (Intermittent Claudication, Fontaine stage II) attended the laboratory for a screening visit and two experimental visits during which bilateral lower limb heating was carried out via water bath immersion (42C; 40 cm depth) for either 15 or 45 minutes. Clinical and cardiovascular measures including resting single leg popliteal artery blood flow (Doppler ultrasound), ABI, and toe oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) were carried out prior to and beginning 10 minutes following limb heating. Popliteal vascular conductance (PVC) was calculated as flow/mean arterial pressure. 6MWD and time/distance to pain onset were measured on the screening day and each experimental day 45 minutes post‐leg immersion. The 15 minute leg heating trial increased popliteal artery blood flow from 113.7 to 169.1 mL min−1(48.6%), PVC from 1.41 to 2.15 mL min−1mmHg−1(52.4%), and 6MWD from 660 to 800 feet (21.2%). The 45 minute leg heating trial increased popliteal artery blood flow from 91.8 to 159.3 mL min−1(73.5%), PVC from 1.17 to 1.99 mL min−1mmHg−1(70.6%), and 6MWD from 660 to 770 feet (16.7%). Furthermore, the subject reported onset of leg pain at 2:45 and 325 feet of the screening visit 6MW, which was delayed until 3:00 and 500 feet after the 15 minute leg heating trial and until 4:00 and 550 feet after the 45 minute leg heating trial. Neither of the heating trials evoked changes in ABI or toe oxygen saturation. Although data collection is ongoing, these initial findings suggest that acute lower limb heating in patients with PAD may increase exercise tolerance which, if undertaken routinely, could increase either patient adherence to or efficacy of exercise prescription in this population.\\n\\nSupport or Funding Information\\n\\nSupported by the Salisbury University Faculty Mini‐Grant","authors":["Grant H.

Local heating acutely improves macrovascular dilator function in the upper extremities through a shear stress dependent mechanism. However, the effect of local heating on macro‐and microvascular dilator function of the lower extremities is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that acute local heating improves lower extremity macro‐ and microvascular dilator function. Five healthy subjects (2 females; age 27 ± 4 years; height 166 ± 4 cm; weight 65 ± 7 kg; mean ± SD) immersed their lower extremities at a depth of ~33 cm into a circulated water bath (42.5 ± 0.4°C) for 45 min. Superficial femoral artery blood flow and diameter (Doppler ultrasound) were measured prior to and every 15 min during heating. Intestinal temperature, skin and skeletal muscle temperatures of the calf were measured. Prior to and 30 min after heating, macro‐ (flow‐mediated dilation) and microvascular (3 min reactive hyperemia area under the curve) dilator function were assessed in the superficial femoral artery following 5 min of arterial occlusion. Local heating increased superficial femoral artery blood flow (pre 63.7 ± 10.8 mL min−1vs. 45 min local heating 606.3 ± 54.3 mL min−1) and shear rate (pre 51.5 ± 12.9 s−1vs. 45 min local heating 410.6 ± 70.9 s−1; bothP< 0.05). Intestinal temperature (Δ0.7 ± 0.1°C), calf skin temperature (Δ9.1 ± 0.1°C), and muscle temperature (Δ8.3 ± 0.6°C; allP< 0.05) increased at 45 min local heating. Macrovascular dilator function was unchanged following heating (pre 4.6 ± 1.1% vs. post 4.6 ± 0.7%;P= 0.8). Microvascular dilator function increased following local heating (pre 456 ± 89 mL vs. post 605 ± 101 mL;P= 0.02). However, after normalizing for differences in baseline blood flow, microvascular dilator function did not differ (pre 423 ± 71 mL vs. post 556 ± 91 mL;P= 0.2). Taken together, local heating of the lower extremities increases blood flow and shear rate similar to that previously observed in the upper extremities.

This suggests that a supplier should be indifferent between the two contracts. However, the sequence and magnitude of costs and revenues (i.e., losses and gains) vary significantly between the contracts, suggesting the supplier’s preference of contract type, and associated contract parameter values, may vary with the level of loss aversion. We investigate this phenomenon through two studies. The first is a preliminary study investigating whether human suppliers are indeed indifferent between these two contracts. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, with human subjects taking on the role of the supplier having to choose between contracts, we find that contract preferences change with the ratio of overage and underage costs for the channel (i.e., the newsvendor critical ratio). In particular, a buyback contract is preferred for products with low critical ratio, whereas revenue sharing is preferred for products with high critical ratio. We show these results are consistent with the behavioral tendency of loss aversion and are more significant for subjects who exhibit higher loss aversion tendencies in an out of context task. In the second (main) study, we examine differences in the performance of buyback and revenue-sharing contracts when suppliers have the authority to set contract parameters. We find that the contract frame influences the way parameters are set and the critical ratio again plays an important role. More specifically, revenue-sharing contracts are more profitable for the supplier than buyback contracts in a high critical ratio environment when accounting for the supplier’s parameter-specification behavior. Also, there is little difference in performance between the two contracts in a low critical ratio environment. These results can help inform supply managers on what types of contracts to use in different critical ratio settings.\\n\\nData, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2182 .\\n\\nThis paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management.","authors":["Tony Haitao Cui","Karen Donohue","Yinghao Zhang"],"journal":"Management Science","datePublished":"2016-6","aiKeywords":["Supplier Preferences","Loss Aversion","Behavioral Operations","Critical Ratios","Supply Chain Management","Contract Types"],"facultyKeywords":["Social sciences nec","Business","Public policy analysis, general","Economics, general","Social sciences, other","Business administration and management nec","Applied economics","Public policy analysis","Economics","Business administration and management","Business management and administration","Social sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2182","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1177/0276236616628278","type":"paper","title":"Memories","abstract":"The fallibility of memory has important implications for various disciplinary fields, as well as societal interests.

In this study, we apply a self‐organizing map classification to integrated vapor transport data from the ERA‐Interim reanalysis to determine if these GrIS mass loss trends are linked to increases in moisture transport to Greenland. We find that “moist” days (i.e., days featuring anomalously intense water vapor transport to Greenland) were significantly more common during 2000–2015 compared to 1979–1994. Furthermore, the two most intense GrIS melt seasons during the last 36 years were either preceded by a record percentage of moist winter days (2010) or occurred during a summer with a record frequency of moist days (2012). We hypothesize that moisture transport events alter the GrIS energy budget by increasing downwelling longwave radiation and turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent energy.","authors":["Rohi Muthyala","Joshua J.

In the presence of masking noise, but not in its absence, frog-eating bats preferred and were faster in attacking a robotic frog emitting multiple sensory cues. The behavioral changes induced by masking noise were accompanied by an increase in active localization through echolocation.

As social critique, these displays examine the political and economic causes and consequences of waste production and resulting ecological degradation. Drawing on Herbert Marcuse’s conceptions of aesthetics, liberation, and ecology in capitalism, this article attempts to discern where we might find hope, encouragement, and active imagination of another possible future through artistic installations. This article cautions that garbage art may both open and close off creative and imaginative spaces for transformation to a liberated society. Differentiating between two categories of art installations, this article explores how installations can reflect back to us our complicated relationship with waste and consumer culture, raising questions as to how the aesthetic realm might serve as a springboard for critique of capitalism.\\n\\n## Notes\\n1.

This study examines current trends in the international expansion plans of United States franchisors using a unique data set drawn from 438 announcements on the International Franchise Association's website made by 85 franchisors over nine years. The findings describe the scope, duration, markets, entry modes used, and expansion rationale. Contrary to past practices, United States franchisors are more focused on expanding into the emerging markets of Asia rather than the developed markets of the West. It appears that they are attracted by the growth in these markets. Finally, the results are used to summarize the key trends in international franchise expansion and to generate propositions for future research.

These data on the reasons for expansion were qualitative and thus were analyzed using the principles of constant comparison (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The data were classified by simultaneously coding and comparing statements to identify the main themes in the reasons provided. The first round yielded a total of 11 themes. These 11 themes were then combined using a similar approach into 8 categories or themes. Four of the themes pertained to factors external to the firm and 3 of the themes pertained to factors internal to the firm. A final category consisted of reasons for expansion that included factors both internal and external to the firm.\\n3.

We find that the four northern estuaries of Ecuador contain approximately 7,742,999 t (±15.47 percent) of standing carbon. Of particularly high carbon holdings are the Rhizophora mangle–dominated mangrove stands found in and around the Cayapas-Mataje Ecological Reserve in northern Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador, and certain stands of Rhizophora mangle in and around the Isla Corazón y Fragata Wildlife Refuge in central Manabí Province, Ecuador. Our field-driven mangrove carbon estimate is higher than all but one of the comparison models evaluated. We find that basic latitudinal mangrove carbon models performed at least as well, if not better, than the more complex species-based allometric models in predicting standing carbon levels. In addition, we find that improved results occur when multiple models are combined as opposed to relying on any one single model for mangrove carbon estimates. The high level of carbon contained in these mangrove forests, combined with the future atmospheric carbon sequestration potential they offer, makes it a necessity that they are included in any future payment for ecosystem services strategy aimed at using forest systems to offset CO2 emissions and mitigate predicted CO2-driven temperature increases.\\n\\nKey Words: carbon stock, coastal resources, Ecuador, mangrove forests\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors thank Ramon Cedeno-Loor for assistance in Ecuador.

Its prevalence is expected to reach unprecedented levels as the U.S. population ages; consequently, it is poised to place a significant burden on the healthcare system. Given the growing body of evidence regarding the patterns of use in this age group and the serious consequences of its misuse, it is critical that nurses and other healthcare providers assess for AUD in order to identify older adults in need of treatment. Yet, differences in symptom presentation, problems in isolating the symptoms of AUD from other healthcare complaints associated with aging, as well as the denial and fear of stigma that is especially pervasive in this age group, are major barriers to its identification and subsequent treatment. Furthermore, the lack of consistent use of evidence-based, age-specific screening instruments to identify those at risk is another significant obstacle to successful treatment. Healthcare providers in primary care are especially well-positioned to perform a systematic assessment utilizing appropriate instruments to identify AUD and initiate age-specific interventions, including the use of alcohol screening and brief interventions (ASBIs). The use of ASBIs, along with other targeted interventions such as mutual help groups (MHGs), such as Alcoholics Anonymous, can be key in encouraging insight, dismantling denial, and supporting treatment success, lifelong recovery, and overall quality of life in this vulnerable group.\\n\\n**Declaration of Interest:** The authors report no conflict of interest.

Therapy provides optimism for the future but requires a collaborative effort among the patient, surgeon, rehabilitation provider, and patient's caregiver(s). Furthermore, patients expressed frustration that their expectations for recovery did not match the reality of the process, including greater dependence on caregivers than expected.\\n\\n## Conclusions:\\nPatients' expectations should be elicited before surgery and managed throughout the recovery process. Providing preoperative patient and caregiver education and encouraging preoperative rehabilitation can assist in managing expectations. Establishing realistic goals and expectations may improve rehabilitation adherence, encourage optimism for recovery, and improve outcomes in the long term.","authors":["Carl G.

This commentary emphasizes the importance of coordinating perspectives from statistics education and mathematics education through boundary interactions between the two communities of practice. I argue that such interactions are particularly vital in shared problem spaces related to the teaching and learning of measurement, variability, and contextualized problems. Collaborative work within these shared problem spaces can contribute to the vitality of each discipline. Neglect of the shared problem spaces may contribute to insularity and have negative consequences for research and school curricula.

Using two waves of data collection separated by 2.5 years, this study examined the relationship between PCO and work–life balance among a sample of 367 college‐educated employees in the United States. Analysis was conducted to empirically distinguish PCO from conceptually related constructs, and structural equation modeling was used to examine the process that explains the linkage between PCO and balance. We found that PCO was positively related to work–life balance. We also found support for the role of several resources (social capital, psychological capital, and perceived employability) that explain the relationship between PCO and balance. In particular, PCO was associated with extensive career planning activities that were related to the accumulation of three forms of career capital—human capital, social capital, and psychological capital. In turn, social capital and psychological capital were associated with high employability, which was related to greater work–life balance for individuals who take a whole‐life perspective on their careers. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings and provide suggestions for future research. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","authors":["Marco S. Direnzo","Christy H.

However, little is known about the factors influencing the local distribution of invasive earthworms south of the Wisconsinan glaciation. Earthworms were sampled at suspected sites of introduction near Mountain Lake Biological Field Station, Virginia,USA. The density of invasive earthworms decreased as distance from suspected sites of introduction increased; native earthworms displayed the opposite relationship. However, the distance thatL. terrestriswas found into the forest was less than expected given dispersal rates calculated from more northern invasions. We also found correlations among population densities ofL. terrestrisand physical–chemical properties of the soil, and differences between field and forest soils in terms of temperature, moisture, and soil chemical properties. We conducted two experiments to analyze some factors possibly responsible for the observed distribution: (1) temperature and moisture, and (2) soil type (field vs. forest) and food resources. Our results suggest thatL. terrestrismay not disperse as far into forested habitats of the Southern Appalachians compared to northern forests due to local physical‐chemical soil characteristics.","authors":["Tami S.

The overall objective of this project was to extract chicken collagen from by-products of the broiler processing industries and to explore the possibility of making films. Chicken skin was washed, ground, and pretreated to remove the noncollagenous compounds. Collagen was extracted using acetic acid and pepsin. Solubilized collagen was salted-out and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g at 4°C for one hour. The precipitates were dissolved in 0.5 M acetic acid and dialyzed against 0.1 M acetic acid and distilled water before freeze-drying. Molecular weight, collagen solubility at different pH values, and NaCl concentrations were determined. TA-XT2 texture analyzer was used to characterize mechanical properties of collagen films. The highest collagen solubility was obtained at pH 2 and 2% NaCl. Hand-homogenized, nonfiltered, and conditioned samples had the highest hardness (3,262 g) and the least brittleness (30.5 mm). These results demonstrate that chicken collagen extracted from chicken by-products has the ability to form films and could be considered for making casings or be used in various other industries.","authors":["Kumudini A.

Sri Lanka obviously was a place to focus due to its strategic location and the sustained relationship between the two states since the middle of the last century. The end of the ethnic war in Sri Lanka in 2009 allowed the government headed by President Rajapaksa to openly embrace China. Presently, China supplies military hardware to the Sri Lankan government, makes financial donations, invests in large infrastructure projects, and defends Sri Lanka internationally on human-rights-related issues. The rapid buildup of China in Sri Lanka has created security concerns in New Delhi. India however, could not arrest or slow down the Chinese inroads into Sri Lanka with its feeble response. The lukewarm response primarily was caused by the belief in harmonious coexistence with China among the top leadership in New Delhi.","authors":["S. I.

Further, a Blooming tool for drawing exercises is provided, as are suggestions to help instructors address possible barriers to implementing and assessing drawing-to-learn in the classroom.

We examine the efficacy of PFS as a surrogate for OS in ACP. Methods: The Peninsula Regional Medical Center Cancer Registry was used as a database to measure PFS and OS from 82 consecutive cancer deaths in Wicomico County, Maryland beginning January 1, 2014 for which RECIST 1.1 guidelines could be obtained. Of the total, there were 33 females and 31 lung cancer patients. Logarithm transformation of PFS and OS was done to obtain normality of residuals for valid linear regression analyses. Results: For all cancers, the median PFS was 6.2 months, and the median OS was 15.6 months. For the lung cancer subset, the median PFS was 4.1 months, and the median OS was 13.8 months. PFS predicted for OS 30.5% and 32.3% of the time, respectively. Conclusions: PFS was not a suitable surrogate for OS in this sample of cancer deaths from our institution.\\n\\nThis is an ASCO Meeting Abstract from the 2015 ASCO Annual Meeting I.

Useful data were available for analysing vertical and horizontal habitat use from 28 individuals. Time at liberty ranged from 10 to 181 d (mean 115, SD 53.3). Seasonal southerly fall migration routes were documented for fish released off the northeastern United States, while those released off Aruba remained in the Caribbean basin. Horizontal movements ranged from 228 to 8084 km (19–100 km d−1) based on light-level geolocation estimates using a sea surface temperature and bathymetry-corrected Kalman filter. Analyses included an evaluation of vertical movements using ΔT, the time spent at temperature relative to the uniform temperature surface layer. Movements included exploration of depths as great as 387 m and ambient temperatures as low as 7.8°C. However, the greatest proportion of time was spent in the upper 20 m of the water column for both day (50.8%) and night (81.6%), and time spent in water colder than 7°C below the uniform temperature surface layer was negligible. Overall, this group showed less variability in vertical movement, and less tolerance to colder temperatures compared with similar studies for blue marlin Makaira nigricans and sailfish Istiophorus platypterus. Values for ΔT are presented in tabular format to allow direct input into habitat standardization models used to estimate vertical distribution and population abundance. The large spatial dispersion and disparate tracks illustrated in the present study serve to underscore the complexity of white marlin behaviour and habitat use, and further emphasize the many challenges facing the management and conservation of this overexploited species.","authors":["Eric D.

The pre-packaged baby food paradigm started shifting in the 1960s– 1970s when Americans were questioning everything and returning to nature. Baby food, both home-made and commercial, began including a broader range of tastes, textures and flavours. Over the past 40–50 years, American adults have grown in their awareness of gourmet, ethnic and organic foods, not only for themselves but for their babies. The current trend of French influences on American parenting and food choices supports the reawakening trend in the United States of savouring food for pleasure, enjoying home-cooked meals, and demanding diverse high-quality commercial foods, not only for adults but for children as well. This French-infused American food renaissance is reflected in rapidly declining sales of traditional US baby food products, and the subsequent industry reinvention to meet new demands. Baby foods now include pomegranate, kale, quinoa, spices, and other ingredients that were not available in mass-marketed baby foods a decade ago.","authors":["Chrys Egan","Sara Lewis Dunne"],"journal":"European Journal of American Culture","datePublished":"2015-6-1","aiKeywords":["Evolution of baby food","Influence of French culinary practices","Cultural shifts in parenting","Market response to changing consumer preferences","Awareness of gourmet and organic foods"],"facultyKeywords":["Agricultural sciences and natural resources","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","Food science and technology","Natural resources and conservation","Area studies","Humanities and humanistic studies","Social sciences","Humanities, other","Environmental natural resources management and policy","Humanities","Ethnic studies","Sociology, demography, and population studies","Natural resources conservation and research","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies nec","Sociology, general","Agricultural, animal, plant, and veterinary sciences","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1386/ejac.34.2.113_1","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.2308/jiar-51194","type":"paper","title":"Job Autonomy and Counterproductive Behaviors in Chinese Accountants: The Role of Job-Related Attitudes","abstract":"Counterproductive behaviors are of concern for all organizations. In addition to explicit financial costs, these behaviors can be detrimental to interpersonal and intraorganizational dynamics and morale, and they can generate negative reputational effects. The accounting literature has long maintained that job autonomy is critical in allowing accountants to apply accounting standards. Prior accounting literature calls for research investigating job autonomy and accounting professionalism. This study answers that call for research. We employ structural equation modeling to evaluate a sample of experienced Chinese accountants from a variety of industries and find a direct, positive, and deleterious effect between job autonomy and counterproductive behaviors.

Introduction\\nUrban sprawl has been a major challenge facing planners and policymakers in the United States. It increases infrastructure costs, gas consumption, air pollution, traffic congestion, farmland loss, and environmental degradation. It has led to social segregation and the decline of central cities as a result of middle- and upper-class flights to suburbs (Carruthers Citation2002). To curb sprawl, several American states have adopted smart growth programmes that use governmental funds as incentives to direct development into designated areas, and to preserve environmentally sensitive lands (Hirt Citation2007). This incentive-based approach that rewards, but does not enforce, local compliance with state policies makes smart growth applications rely mainly on local government decisions to manage urban growth (Downs Citation2005).\\n\\nPrevious studies, mostly quantitative, provided mixed results of local factors contributing to smart growth applications. Moreover, little research examined the effects of technical capacity on local land-use planning. Brody et al. (Citation2006) point to needs for case study analysis of jurisdictions to demonstrate causes of local adoption of anti-sprawl land-use policies, while Edwards and Haines (Citation2007) call for research exploring the extent of integrating smart growth policies into local comprehensive plans. Therefore, this research paper applies case study analysis to investigate the impacts of technical capacity on city/town decisions to adopt smart growth policies.\\n\\nThe paper examines smart growth applications in 10 cities/towns located in the State of Maryland (USA), which has adopted a statewide smart growth programme since the mid-1990s. It explores effects of city/town technical planning capacity (PC) on applications of smart growth policies to reduce urban sprawl. Also, the paper investigates other local factors contributing to policy applications. The analysis depends on three sources of evidence: content analysis of city/town comprehensive plans, structured interviews with city/town planners, and secondary data. First, the paper reviews the literature on factors contributing to smart growth applications; then it explains the research methodology, Maryland’s smart growth programme, findings of the case study analysis, and research conclusions and policy implications.\\n\\n## 2. Research on factors associated with smart growth applications\\nThe American Planning Association (Citation2012) defines smart growth as the development that “supports choice and opportunity by promoting efficient and sustainable land development, incorporates redevelopment patterns that optimise prior infrastructure investments, and consumes less land that is otherwise available for agriculture, open space, natural systems, and rural lifestyles.” Downs (Citation2005) identifies six principles of smart growth: adopting growth controls, encouraging compact development and high residential densities, creating mixed land uses and pedestrian-friendly design, issuing impact fees to make new development pay for infrastructure costs, promoting public transit and multi-modal transportation, and revitalising old neighbourhoods. Smart growth policies to reduce urban sprawl can be divided into two major groups: (1) land preservation policies/programmes such as transfer of development rights (TDR), conservation easements, urban growth boundaries (UGBs), and greenbelts; and (2) inner city management policies including compact development, transit-oriented development, and planned unit development (PUD) among others (Brody et al. Citation2006; O’Connell Citation2009).\\n\\nSeveral American states led by Maryland have adopted statewide smart growth programmes that usually consist of a package of incentives and mandates to guide local land-use planning. State incentives include, but are not limited to, tax credits and funds covering costs of infrastructure and public facilities in areas designated for future growth; in contrast, mandates focus on local comprehensive planning and measures to protect environmentally sensitive areas. Berke and French (Citation1994) found positive impacts of state mandates on the quality of local plans, while Dalton and Burby (Citation1994) indicated that municipalities subject to state mandates would use effective measures to implement their comprehensive plans. Burby et al. (Citation1997) and Carruthers (Citation2002) observed associations between state mandates of local comprehensive planning and applications of growth management policies. Yin and Sun (Citation2007) pointed to effects of state growth management programmes on promoting compact development in terms of high residential density and mixed land uses. Also, Hawkins (Citation2011) showed that local government dependency on state resources would affect smart growth applications.\\n\\nPrevious research provided mixed results of local factors contributing to smart growth applications. Baldassare and Wilson (Citation1996) found no correlation between population growth and adoption of land-use controls; however, Wassmer and Lascher (Citation2006) and Boarnet et al. (Citation2011) showed evidence supporting that correlation. Nguyen (Citation2009) emphasised that resident concerns about rapid urban growth and its unintended consequences would lead cities to apply smart growth policies to reduce sprawl. Educated residents tend to support smart growth policies, as Chapin and Connerly (Citation2004) suggested. Schneider and Kim (Citation1996) and Brody et al. (Citation2006) argued that communities with high incomes would support growth management policies, while O’Connell (Citation2009) showed negative associations between incomes and establishing land preservation programmes in large American cities.\\n\\nIn addition, Wassmer (Citation2001) indicates that local governments apply “imbalanced” land-use policies that favour commercial development to generate high tax revenues. Nguyen (Citation2009) explains how communities apply smart growth policies as a “strategic interaction” to growth spillover resulting from the adoption of growth controls by neighbouring jurisdictions.\\n\\nFew studies investigated the effects of the technical capacity of local planning departments on adopted land-use policies. Brody et al. (Citation2006) found positive correlations between applications of anti-sprawl land-use policies and community technical PC in south Florida, and Ali (Citation2007) argues that the technical capacity of local planning agencies enables planners to involve the public in decision-making processes and to reorient planning policies towards growth management. This research re-examines the effects of technical capacity on local land-use policies to manage future growth.\\n\\n## 3. Research methodology\\nThis research paper applies case study analysis to address two major questions: does city/town technical PC contribute to applications of smart growth policies to reduce urban sprawl? and what are the other factors affecting policy applications? The research unit of analysis is a city/town that has 5000 or more inhabitants, is located in the State of Maryland (USA), and has authority for land-use planning.\\n\\nThe researcher conducted content analysis of the cities/towns’ most recent comprehensive plans to assess how they embrace smart growth policies. An evaluation protocol was developed to examine five categories of smart growth policies seeking to reduce urban sprawl: land-use policies to increase urban density, redevelopment and revitalisation policies, growth controls, infrastructure provisions, and land-conservation policies/programmes (see Downs Citation2005; Brody et al. Citation2006; O’Connell Citation2009; Litman Citation2012 among others). The researcher used a scheme proposed by Norton (Citation2008) to score levels of smart growth policy applications. A policy is scored 0 if it is not mentioned in the city/town comprehensive plan, 1 if it is proposed or encouraged, or 2 if it will be implemented. The maximum smart growth score a city/town could earn is 42. The preliminary analysis shows that city/town scores of smart growth applications range from 5 to 25 with an average of 17. Therefore, the adopted scale of smart growth applications is: low = less than 17 and high = 17 or more. The researcher was the sole coder of the content analysis.\\n\\nThe city/town technical PC is measured by an index expressing planner–population ratio and levels of planner education and years of professional experienceFootnote1 (the PC index is expressed as: low = less than 8 and high = 8 or more). Based on the literature review, four hypotheses were examined to address the research questions:\\n- The technical capacity of city/town planning departments/divisions enables them to apply smart growth policies to reduce urban sprawl.\\n- County adoption of growth management policies leads cities/towns to apply smart growth policies to combat sprawl. In other words, county land-use policies influence city/town land-use planning.\\n- Public concerns about rapid urban growth and its unintended consequences motivate cities/towns to manage future development. Thus, cities/towns adopt land-use policies that meet residents’ development preferences.\\n- Applications of growth controls by neighbouring jurisdictions lead cities/towns to implement smart growth policies that address development pressures resulting from potential growth spillover.\\n\\nThe researcher conducted structured phone interviews with the cities/towns’ planners to examine the research hypotheses. The interviews had closed and open-ended questions. For confidentiality purposes, this paper does not indicate information about the interviewees. The researcher used secondary data obtained from the US Census Bureau, Maryland Department of Planning, and the cities/towns to support the case study analysis.\\n\\n## 3.1. Selecting the case studies\\nThe preliminary analysis identifies 33 cities/towns (excluding Baltimore City with over 600,000 people) that meet the criteria of the research unit of analysis: 16 cities/towns with 5000 to less than 10,000 people, eight cities/towns with 10,000 to less than 20,000 people, five cities/towns with 20,000 to less than 30,000, and four cities with 30,000 or more people. Out of the identified 33 cities/towns, the researcher selected 10 case study cities/towns that: (1) represent pairs/groups with comparable population size, which ensures similarities of municipal needs and problems, (2) vary in levels of smart growth applications, which enables examinations of factors contributing to policy variations, and (3) are located in different counties, which allows investigations of the effects of land-use policies adopted by counties and neighbouring jurisdictions (see Figure 1 showing the selected case studies).\\n\\nFigure 1. The location of the case studies within Maryland’s counties.\\n\\nThe case study cities/towns represent four pairs/groups:\\n- Gaithersburg and Frederick City (>30,000 people) are both located in the Region of Washington, DC, the US capital. Gaithersburg’s county (Montgomery) has applied smart growth policies to direct growth into existing communities, while Frederick City’s county (Frederick) has not adopted such policies.\\n- Laurel, Salisbury, and Cumberland (20,000 to <30,000 inhabitants) have different population growth patterns: Laurel and Salisbury are growing, but Cumberland is declining. Planning in Cumberland and Laurel is performed by city/town planning departments, while Salisbury’s planning is conducted by the county planning department through a city–county agreement.\\n- Easton and Havre de Grace (10,000 to <20,000 residents) are located in counties having different land-use policies. Easton is located in Talbot County that has adopted policies to discourage development outside incorporated areas, while Havre de Grace is located in Harford County that has not initiated growth management policies.\\n- Taneytown, Brunswick, and Walkersville (5000 to <10,000 people) are small bedroom communities. Taneytown’s county (Carroll) attempts to contain urban growth within existing communities, while Walkersville and Brunswick’s county (Frederick) has not adopted growth controls.\\n\\n## 4. Maryland’s smart growth\\nThe State of Maryland has made serious efforts to reduce urban sprawl that led to converting thousands of acres of farmlands and forests into suburban development. It requires local governments to prepare comprehensive plans that guide future development decisions. Also, the State mandates plan elements such as land uses, transportation, sensitive areas, water resources, and municipal growth patterns among others. Local comprehensive plans should be reviewed and updated every six years.\\n\\nIn 1992 the State passed the Economic Growth, Resource Protection, and Planning Act that introduced eight planning visions, which were replaced with 12 new visions in 2009. The new State visions seek to concentrate growth in designated areas, promote compact development and mixed-use and walkable neighbourhood design, ensure the availability of infrastructure to serve new development, enhance multimodal and affordable transportation, offer a variety of housing types and densities, protect water resources including the Chesapeake and coastal bays, and conserve forests, farmlands, open space, natural systems, and scenic areas. The State visions should be addressed in local comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances, and land-use regulations (Maryland Annotated Code Article 66 B, S 1.01).\\n\\nIn 1997 Maryland adopted the Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation-Smart Growth Areas Act that aimed to contain urban growth inside Priority Funding Areas (PFAs).Footnote3 The State requires the residential density of new development within the PFAs to be 3.5 or more housing units per acre. Incentives in terms of State funds covering infrastructure costs are used to direct development into the PFAs. The State created the Job Creation Tax Credit, Live Near Your Work, and the Voluntary Brownfields Cleanup and Redevelopment incentive programmes to encourage business and people to locate inside the PFAs (Cohen Citation2002; Knaap Citation2005). Furthermore, Maryland established the Rural Legacy Program to preserve environmentally sensitive lands, and authorised local governments to adopt the TDR programmes in which the PFAs serve as receiving areas (Maryland Annotated Code Article 66 B Land Use § 11.01) and to establish purchase of development rights programmes to protect farmlands participating in the Rural Legacy Program.\\n\\nIn 2009 Maryland enacted the Smart Growth Goals, Measures, and Indicators and Implementation of Planning Visions Law that requires local planning commissions/boards to submit annual reports addressing smart growth measures and indicators including growth amounts, densities, numbers of new residential and commercial building permits issued, and amounts of farmland acres preserved. Also, localities should develop a percentage goal and a timeframe for achieving the state policies to concentrate development within the PFAs. Annual reports should indicate local regulations enacted or changed in order to implement the state planning visions (Maryland Annotated Code Article 66 B, S 3.10.c.1). In December 2011, the State adopted PlanMaryland, the state’s first comprehensive plan that guides future land-use planning to create smart and sustainable development.\\n\\n## 5. Research findings\\n### 5.1. Smart growth applications in the cities/towns\\nThe content analysis of the case study cities/towns’ most recent comprehensive plans shows variations in their embracement of smart growth policies (see Table 2). Laurel has the highest smart growth profile, while Walkersville has the lowest. Most case study cities/towns adopt smart growth policies to accommodate future growth and reduce its potential negative impacts. Easton is the only town that applies several growth controls including UGBs, greenbelts, and phasing development. Historic preservation policies are widely adopted, and mixed-use development and downtown revitalisation policies are used to stimulate economic growth and reduce traffic congestion. About 60% of the cities/towns establish residential densities with more than 3.5 housing units per acre, while 70% have Adequate Public Facilities Ordinances (APFOs) or other provisions to ensure the adequacy of public infrastructure and services to support new development. Half of the cities/towns propose conservation policies to protect forests, open space, and other environmentally sensitive lands.\\n\\nThe examination of the technical capacity of city/town planning departments produces two major groups of cities/towns: a group with high levels of both PC and another with low capacity levels. Table 3 suggests positive effects of technical PC on city/town applications of smart growth policies to reduce urban sprawl, which supports the first research hypothesis. Easton, Frederick, Gaithersburg, and Laurel have high levels of PC and smart growth applications, while Brunswick, Cumberland, Havre de Grace, and Walkersville have low PC and smart growth profiles. Salisbury and Taneytown with no professional planners have formed city–county agreements that enable county planning departments to perform city land-use planning. Therefore, their smart growth applications are affected by the extent of their county embracement of anti-sprawl policies.\\n\\nFurthermore, Table 3 demonstrates that historic preservation policies are adopted by all case study cities/towns, while Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and infill development are applied by cities/towns with high technical PC such as Easton, Frederick, and Laurel. Mixed-use development policies are used by Brunswick, Cumberland, Havre de Grace, and Walkersville that have low technical capacity and by Salisbury and Taneytown receiving county’s technical assistance in land-use planning. Cities whose planning is performed by county planning departments apply overlay zoning, downtown revitalisation, and cluster development to accommodate future growth.\\n\\nThe following narratives explain factors contributing to smart growth applications in four pairs/groups of cities/towns: (1) Gaithersburg and Frederick, (2) Laurel, Salisbury, and Cumberland, (3) Easton and Havre de Grace, and (4) Taneytown, Brunswick, and Walkersville. They address the research hypotheses exploring the effects of the technical capacity of city/town planning departments/divisions, county adoption of growth management policies, public concerns about rapid growth and its unintended consequences, and applications of growth controls by neighbouring jurisdictions.\\n\\n### 5.1.1. Gaithersburg and Frederick\\nGaithersburg and Frederick are the largest cities among the case study cities/towns (59,933 and 65,239 people, respectively). They witnessed steady population growth because of their location in the region of Washington, DC, the US capital. Their high smart growth profiles can be explained by the first three hypotheses. However, the case study analysis of cities/towns does not provide sufficient evidence to support the fourth hypothesis regarding the effects of growth control policies adopted by neighbouring jurisdictions.\\n\\nGaithersburg is surrounded by unincorporated areas that would be annexed in order to expand the city horizontally (Figure 2a). It has adopted smart growth policies such as high residential density with an average of 8.73 housing units per acre, cluster development, infill development, and mixed uses to accommodate future growth. Also, the city established an APFO to ensure that new development would meet city standards for traffic impacts, school, water and sewer capacity, and fire and emergency services provisions. Gaithersburg’s high technical PC (more than one-third of the planning staff has graduate degrees: two in planning and one in non-planning fields) has enabled it to apply smart growth policies. The city is located in Montgomery County that has established a TDR programme designating the city as a receiving area, which has motivated it to manage its future growth.\\n\\nFrederick City is adjacent to agricultural lands presenting an opportunity for future growth (Figure 2b); however, the insufficiency of water and sewer capacity has slowed down land annexations. The city has applied smart growth policies including high density with an average of 7.83 housing units per acre, compact development, and an APFO to accommodate growth and ensure the adequacy of public facilities. The city’s high technical PC (half of the planners have a graduate degree: three in planning and two in non-planning fields) has enabled it to manage future growth. Frederick County did not seem to have significant impacts on the city’s land-use policies till 2008 when the county adopted an initiative to update its comprehensive plan and designate growth areas. The county initiative stimulated development in existing municipalities including Frederick City. Residents are in favour of the city’s growth as a regional centre, but call for preserving its historic character and limiting sprawl that leads to traffic congestion and inadequate infrastructure.\\n\\n### 5.1.2. Laurel, Salisbury, and Cumberland\\nLaurel, Salisbury, and Cumberland are medium-sized cities with 25,115, 28,925, and 20,859 inhabitants, respectively, as of 2010. Laurel has the highest smart growth profile and is the least sprawling, while Cumberland has the lowest profile and is the most sprawling. The City of Laurel supports the research hypotheses on the effects of technical PC, public concerns about growth, and neighbouring jurisdiction adoption of growth controls. Salisbury’s lack of public concerns about sprawl and focus on social problems seem to hinder potential land-use reforms (hypothesis three). On the other hand, Cumberland’s desire to reverse its declining growth has led to the use of revitalisation policies to stimulate economic growth.\\n\\nLaurel applies smart growth policies to respond to rapid growth resulting from its midway location between Washington, DC, and Baltimore (Figure 3a). The case study analysis supports all, but the second, research hypothesis. There is no sufficient evidence showing effects of county applications of smart growth management policies. Laurel’s technical PC (four full-time planners with graduate degrees) and public preferences to manage future growth led the Mayor to support smart growth policies. Prince George’s County where the city is located was inactive in smart growth policies till the early 2000s. However, Laurel’s proximity to Montgomery County adopting a TDR programme has caused growth spillover. Therefore, the city adopted smart growth policies that encourage economic growth and reduce traffic congestion resulting from rapid growth. For example, it applied cluster development, PUD, mixed uses, and TOD. Also, it created a commercial village along the main street and an overlay zone for high residential densities. Laurel’s subdivision ordinance sets conditions for the availability of water resources and utilities to serve new development.\\n\\nSalisbury has grown along highways US13 and US50 (Figure 3b). It has excessively annexed farmlands representing 14% (1270 acres) of its total land area as of 2007. Since the city does not have its own professional planners, it has formed an agreement with Wicomico County by which the County Department of Planning, Zoning and Community Development performs city planning functions. The county has not adopted growth controls and attempts to accommodate urban growth. Therefore, the city applies land-use policies such as medium residential density (an average of 3.98 housing units per acre) and infill development to accommodate growth. Elected officials’ disinterests in managing city growth and concerns with resolving problems of crimes, traffic jams, and unemployment reflect the public indifference to urban sprawl.\\n\\nCumberland provides different insights about the research hypothesis. It has low technical PC (one full-time planner with a master’s degree in planning), and receives technical assistance from both the county and state planning departments. The public has been concerned with the city’s steady decline as a result of the demise of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and railroad lines (City of Cumberland Citation2004). The city’s geographic features limit its ability to grow as it is surrounded by steep slopes and bedrocks in the northwest and by floodplains, forests, and agriculture lands preserved by State programmes in the south (Figure 3c). Therefore, Cumberland adopts smart growth policies that attract new business and improve its economy. The city applied policies of compact and infill development, and downtown and neighbourhood revitalisation, and created a conservation zone and a viewship protection ordinance to conserve natural resources.\\n\\n### 5.1.3. Easton and Havre de Grace\\nEaston and Havre de Grace represent small communities (15,945 and 12,952 residents, respectively). Interestingly, Easton has a higher smart growth profile than Havre de Grace, but is more sprawling in terms of land consumption and percentage of multi-unit housing structures. The Town of Easton supports the research’s first three hypotheses. On the other hand, Havre de Grace provides insufficient evidence to support the first two hypotheses as its land-use planning is mostly influenced by public concerns about future growth (hypothesis three) and the technical assistance provided by the State department of planning.\\n\\nEaston’s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay made it subject to development restrictions set by the Maryland Critical Areas Act. The town technical PC (three full-time planners with graduate degrees) has enabled it to apply growth controls. Also, its location in Talbot County adopting downzoning policies has stimulated the town’s rapid growth, which raised public concerns about urban sprawl. Therefore, Easton creates a UGB, limits future annexations to lands located in priority growth areas, and proposes a greenbelt formed mostly by farmlands preserved by State land preservation programmes and county agricultural easements (Figure 4a). The town applies mixed-use development, downtown revitalisation, and historic preservation policies to encourage economic growth and reduce traffic problems; and sets conditions for the availability of public facilities and services to permit new development. It issued an ordinance to conserve wetlands, forests, and open space. However, resident preferences led the town to allow low-density development (an average of 2.27 housing units per acre).\\n\\nHavre de Grace’s growth is restricted by protected and public lands in the south and the Chesapeake Bay in the east (Figure 4b). The city’s low technical PC (none of the city’s staff has a planning degree) has limited its land-use planning. Its pro-growth county (Harford) does not seem to influence the city’s planning as it has not adopted land-use policies to curb urban sprawl. The city’s desire to accommodate future growth and maintain its small and historic town characters has led it to seek the State’s technical assistance in land-use planning, which enabled it to adopt smart growth policies such as high densities, mixed uses, downtown redevelopment, and historic preservation.\\n\\n### 5.1.4. Taneytown, Brunswick, and Walkersville\\nTaneytown, Brunswick, and Walkersville are the smallest among the case study cities/towns (6728, 5870, and 5800 people, respectively). They have low levels of technical PC and smart growth applications. Public concerns about growth motivated Taneytown and Brunswick to apply smart growth policies (hypothesis three). The county’s technical assistance has enabled Taneytown to adopt land-use policies that address water problems and respond to local needs.\\n\\nTaneytown has grown along highways MD194 and MD140 and is surrounded by agricultural lands (Figure 5a). Its lack of surface water, reliance on groundwater, and problems with water contamination have limited its growth capacity. Since Taneytown does not have a professional planner, but a Zoning and Code Enforcement Officer, it formed a city–county agreement through which Carroll County planning department performs the city’s land-use planning. The county promotion of anti-sprawl policies has led the city to apply compact development and traditional neighbourhood design; to set conditions for adequacy of schools, roads, fire, police, water, and sewer services in new development; and to create open space zones to preserve parks, forests, and other natural areas. Also, the city planning commissioners who are motivated by the public preferences have supported smart growth policies to maintain a small town character and address water issues.\\n\\nBrunswick is surrounded by floodplains in the south and protected land in the north (Figure 5b). Despite its low technical PC, the city attempted to comply with the State’s PFA density requirements of 3.5 housing units per acre in order to receive state money to upgrade its infrastructure. Frederick County where the city is located does not seem to affect city land-use planning. However, the public desire to revitalise the city and attract new business has motivated it to adopt smart growth policies such as PUDs and main street redevelopment. It enacted an APFO to ensure the adequacy of public facilities and services to support new development, and passed a forest conservation ordinance to balance natural protection and urban development.\\n\\nWalkersville grows along highway MD194 that connects it with Frederick City (Figure 5c). It has the lowest levels of both technical PC (one part-time planner) and smart growth applications among the case study cities/towns. The town has attempted to increase its tax revenue base by excessively annexing agricultural lands representing 40% (1196 acres) of its total land area as of 2010. Also, residents’ opposition of multifamily housing and concerns about crimes that may accompany high residential densities have led the town to establish low residential density with an average of 2.95 housing units per acre. However, Walkersville adopted an APFO to ensure the sufficiency of roads, water services, and schools to support new development.\\n\\n### 5.2. Summary of the analysis findings\\nTable 4 summarises major findings of the examination of the research hypotheses. The case study analysis agrees with the first three hypotheses, but does not provide sufficient evidence to support the fourth hypothesis as explained below.\\n\\n1st Research hypothesis (effects of city/town technical PC on applications of smart growth policies) is evident by the research analysis. In general, cities/towns with high technical PC tend to have high profiles of smart growth applications, which agrees with Brody et al. (Citation2006) and Ali (Citation2007). The high technical capacity of the planning departments of Laurel, Gaithersburg, Frederick, and Easton has enabled them to apply land-use policies that balance economic growth and environmental protection. On the other hand, the low PC of Havre de Grace, Brunswick, and Walkersville has contributed to their low levels of smart growth applications.\\n\\n2nd Research hypothesis (impacts of county adoption of growth management policies on city/town smart growth applications) is demonstrated by the case study cities/towns. For example, Montgomery County’s TDR programme designating Gaithersburg as a receiving area has motivated the city to adopt smart growth policies that address growth pressures. Also, Talbot County’s land easement programmes preserved farmlands around Easton, which enabled the town to adopt a UGB and propose a greenbelt to contain future growth. When Carroll County planning department performs Taneytown’s planning functions through city–county agreements, it shapes the city’s land-use planning according to the county’s anti-sprawl policies. Also, county technical planning assistance has helped Cumberland and Salisbury apply smart growth policies to accommodate future growth and address city problems.\\n\\n3rd Research hypothesis (effects of public concerns about rapid urban growth and its unintended consequences on city/town applications of smart growth policies) is evident by most cities/towns. Agreeing with Nguyen (Citation2009), resident concerns about the negative effects of urban sprawl have contributed to Frederick, Gaithersburg, Laurel, and Easton’s applications of smart growth policies to reduce urban sprawl and mitigate its negative impacts. On the other hand, Walkersville’s resident preferences of low density have contributed to its sprawling development patterns. Similarly, the public disinterest in land-use reforms or growth controls led Salisbury to excessively annex farmlands.\\n\\n4th Research hypothesis (impacts of adopting growth controls by neighbouring jurisdictions on city/town applications of smart growth policies to reduce urban sprawl) is supported by the City of Laurel. The proximity of Laurel to Montgomery County creating land preservation programmes has led to growth spillover that motivated the city to manage its future growth. However, other cities/towns do not provide sufficient evidence to support that hypothesis.\\n\\nFurthermore, the case study analysis points to other factors contributing to city/town applications of smart growth policies to combat urban sprawl. State mandates make cities/towns adopt smart growth policies, as suggested by Carruthers (Citation2002). For instance, the state mandates of the preparation of water resource and municipal growth elements have led Gaithersburg and Havre de Grace to limit future annexations. In addition, farmlands and forests protected by State land preservation programmes enabled Easton to propose a greenbelt and contain the town’s growth. On the other hand, the State’s PFA incentive programme has not prevented Walkersville from establishing low-density residential development. This observation supports Downs (Citation2005) and Knaap (Citation2005) on the ineffectiveness of incentives to ensure local compliance with state land-use policies.\\n\\n## 6. Conclusions and policy implications\\nThis research paper investigates local factors contributing to city/town applications of smart growth policies to combat urban sprawl in the State of Maryland, USA. The case study analysis supports the first three research hypotheses regarding the effects of city/town technical PC, county adoption of growth management policies, and public concerns about growth patterns on city/town decisions to apply smart growth policies. However, the analysis does not provide sufficient evidence to support the fourth hypothesis on impacts of growth controls adopted by neighbouring jurisdictions.\\n\\nAgreeing with Brody et al. (Citation2006) and Ali (Citation2007), cities/towns with high technical PC apply smart growth policies to manage future development. Therefore, it is important to increase city/town PC in terms of education and personnel in order to improve local land-use planning in general, and smart growth practices in particular. Both the State and the American Planning Association-Maryland Chapter can motivate city/town planners to seek further planning education, and provide them with professional training. The State should help small cities/towns generate revenues sufficient to hire professional planners who are able to reform local land-use policies. Also, the State’s regional planning offices should encourage cities/towns that lack the PC to seek the State’s technical assistance in smart growth applications.\\n\\nCities/towns located in counties adopting anti-sprawl policies are usually informed about the negative effects of urban sprawl and are introduced to a variety of land-use policies to manage urban growth through county plans, meetings, and technical assistance. Thus, they tend to apply smart growth policies to combat sprawl, as shown in Gaithersburg and Easton. This observation points to the importance of promoting county leadership in smart growth applications. Also, enhancing city–county coordination is required in land-use planning in order to design more effective policies that address local needs and growth challenges.\\n\\nIn addition, the research analysis demonstrates the effects of public concerns about urban growth on city/town land-use policies, which agrees with Nguyen (Citation2009). When residents are concerned with negative effects of urban sprawl, cities/towns attempt to manage future growth as shown in Frederick City. On the other hand, resident preferences of low residential density can contribute to urban sprawl as evident by the Town of Walkersville. Therefore, it is important to raise the public awareness of the negative effects of urban sprawl, and to introduce residents to a broad range of smart growth policies that can balance economic development and environmental protection.\\n\\nFinally, the case study analysis indicates that state mandates lead cities/towns to adopt smart growth policies as suggested by Carruthers (Citation2002). However, State incentive programmes do not ensure local compliance with state policies, as Downs (Citation2005) and Knaap (Citation2005) argued. Therefore, further research is needed to explore effective state policies that can help increase local applications of smart growth to combat urban sprawl.\\n\\nTo conclude, the research findings point to needs for more state efforts to rebuild the technical capacity of city/town planning agencies and to promote smart growth applications. Counties can play leading roles in managing local growth as they influence municipal land-use planning through collaboration and technical assistance. Also, the State should create educational programmes to raise the public awareness of the negative effects of urban sprawl and to improve resident knowledge of how smart growth policies can help resolve city/town problems and improve the quality of life. Enhancing state–local partnerships will motivate cities/towns to reform their land-use planning. All of this would improve local applications of smart growth policies and reduce urban sprawl.\\n\\n**Disclosure statement**\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.\\n\\n**Additional information**\\n**Notes on contributors**\\nAmal K.

Assessments of these efforts often find that rates of sustained uptake are disappointingly low and that impacts are difficult to discern, but this could be due to the short‐time frames of both the efforts themselves and their evaluation. We investigate the impacts of participation in an internationally sponsored farmer association that for 15 years promoted sustainable agricultural practices in the heavily deforested state of Rondônia, Brazil. Using data from a georeferenced four‐period panel survey of farmers in combination with remote sensing data on land use spanning the life of the association, we apply matching methods to estimate the impacts of participation. We find that membership resulted in more diversified production systems, including more land allocated to agroforestry.

However, the synthetic result depends greatly on the steric bulk of the Ttz ligand. Synthetic routes adapted from the synthesis of (Tp)ZnOH have been applied to bulky Ttz ligands, but side products often result because Ttz frequently forms complexes with +1 metals or cations used in the synthesis. Nonetheless, (TtztBu,Me)ZnOH (1) has been successfully synthesized and crystallographically characterized, but only via the hydrolysis of the zinc (hexamethylsilyl)azide complex (6). With less bulky ligands, namely TtzPh,Me, routes expected to form LZnOH lead instead to bis(ligand) products, namely [(TtzPh,Me)2Zn] (12). The use of ligands of intermediate steric bulk has led to the isolation of (TtziPr2)ZnOH (2a) which fixes atmospheric CO2to produce [(TtziPr2)Zn]2(μ‐η1‐η2‐CO3) (2b).

In addition, the interaction of FOXA1 with cofactors such as nuclear factor I (NFI) family members modulates AR target gene expression. However, the global role of specific NFI family members has yet to be described in the prostate. In these studies, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells demonstrated that 64.3% of NFIB binding sites are associated with AR and FOXA1 binding sites. Interrogation of published data revealed that genes associated with NFIB binding sites are predominantly induced after dihydrotestosterone treatment of LNCaP cells, whereas NFIB knockdown studies demonstrated that loss of NFIB drives increased AR expression and superinduction of a subset of AR target genes. Notably, genes bound by NFIB only are associated with cell division and cell cycle. To define the role of NFIB in vivo, mouse Nfib knockout prostatic tissue was rescued via renal capsule engraftment. Loss of Nfib expression resulted in prostatic hyperplasia, which did not resolve in response to castration, and an expansion of an intermediate cell population in a small subset of grafts. In human benign prostatic hyperplasia, luminal NFIB loss correlated with more severe disease. Finally, some areas of intermediate cell expansion were also associated with NFIB loss. Taken together, these results show a fundamental role for NFIB as a coregulator of AR action in the prostate and in controlling prostatic hyperplasia.","authors":["Robert J.

Vertical tax competition arises as a state and its local governments tax a common base, while horizontal competition takes place across states, local governments in different states, and between local governments in one state and other states. Our application is unique in focusing on multiple federations and allowance for both intrafederation and interfederation competition. We find negative vertical reaction functions for states and localities indicating that capital tax rates are strategic substitutes. Local tax rates, on the other hand, react positively to other-state tax rates and to the rates of localities elsewhere. State rates are not affected by the rates of localities in other states, but they do react positively to the rates of neighboring states. We find evidence that states behave as Stackelberg leaders in the setting of capital taxes.","authors":["William F. Fox","Matthew N. Murray","Brian C.

Kelman’s intertextual strategies of narrative construction, while obviously simple and overt in their taxonomic variety, including, for example, Adaptation, Retro, Appropriation, Parody, Pastiche and Simulation (according to D’Angelo’s ‘rhetoric of intertextuality’, 2010), also function in subtly complex ways, inevitably entailing a covert, discoursed, hybridized, triumvirate of re-coded, textographic strategies including, but not limited to, multimodal-genre mixing, multisensory visual Englishization, and picturized meaning.

Most experimental studies of the influence of conspecific behavior vary the social environment by the presence or absence of conspecifics or investigate the impact of the outcome of social encounters (winner/loser effects) but less frequently expose individuals to variation in behavioral phenotypes present in the social environment. Based on previous work showing that juveniles of the salamanderPlethodon cinereusare likely to interact frequently with non‐parental adults, I hypothesized that territorial adults in the social environment alter the future behaviors of juveniles. I measured the intracohort social behaviors of juvenile salamanders collected from two geographic areas, Michigan (MI) and Virginia (VA), before and after housing with ostensibly territorial (VA) or non‐territorial (MI) adults. There were overall effects of adult territoriality and aggression on the behavior of juveniles. However, juveniles from populations inMIwere especially susceptible to behavioral modification. Compared with behaviors prior to being housed with adults,MIjuveniles increased investigatory and escape behaviors in juvenile–juvenile interactions after being housed with adults that displayed territorial behaviors and decreased investigatory and escape behaviors after being housed with non‐territorial adults. This study shows that not only is a specific behavior, territoriality of adult salamanders, a social environment that modifies future juvenile behaviors, but the effects of social environment may differ between populations.","authors":["Eric B.

At the same time, research on teachers’ knowledge of variation is in its beginning stages. This study investigated prospective teachers’ knowledge in regard to a specific measure of statistical variation that is new to many curriculum documents: the mean absolute deviation (MAD). Seventy-six prospective teachers participated in the study. Participants exhibited various procedural and conceptual characteristics in their thinking about the MAD. The majority were able to successfully select and carry out a procedure for computing the MAD. However, some had difficulty dealing with procedures for absolute deviations, and others confused the procedure for the MAD with the procedure for a different descriptive statistic. Conceptually, participants offered a variety of interpretations of the MAD, with some demonstrating deep understanding of the measure and others demonstrating shallower understanding or misconceptions. Those who demonstrated the strongest conceptual knowledge of the MAD also exhibited sound procedural understanding, suggesting that the two types of knowledge are intertwined in the process of fully understanding the measure.","authors":["Randall E.

Confirmatory factor analyses supported a structure with two primary factors, General Distress and Ability-to-Cope, loading on a single second-order factor, Perceived Stress. Furthermore, this model was confirmed for designated subpopulations including the 264 accounting majors who participated in the study. Notably absent in prior research, this study found two items, numbers 2 and 9, to load significantly on both the General Distress and Ability-to-Cope factors with men and the full sample, respectively. Item–total correlations, coefficient alphas, and Spearman-Brown reliability coefficients supported the reliability of the items loading on the full scale as well as on each of the two primary factors. Combined, these findings provide compelling evidence in support of the PSS10 as a stress assessment measure for business students in general, and accounting students in particular. In fact, given its practical expediency in terms of administration and scoring, the PSS10 appears to be a tool that could be used by university administrators and potentially by human resource personnel at accounting and business organizations to assess student/employee perceived stress levels before the onset of burnout tendencies, thus facilitating more timely and cost-effective intervention strategies. Une évaluation des propriétés psychométriques de l’échelle de stress perçu à 10 items auprès des étudiants en gestion et en comptabilitéRésuméfr Dans l'analyse d'un échantillon de 557 étudiants de premier cycle en gestion, provenant de trois universités polyvalentes des États-Unis, les auteurs étudient a) la structure factorielle de l’échelle de stress perçu à 10 items (Perceived Stress Scale-10 — PSS10, Cohen et Williamson, 1988); b) l'invariance de sa structure factorielle; c) la fiabilité de l’échelle; et d) sa validité convergente et divergente. Les analyses factorielles confirmatoires accréditent une structure comportant deux facteurs essentiels, l'anxiété générale et la capacité de faire face, avec saturation d'un seul facteur de second ordre, le stress perçu. En outre, ce modèle est confirmé pour des sous-populations définies regroupant les 264 étudiants de majeure en comptabilité ayant participé à l’étude. Les observations des auteurs révèlent que les items 2 et 9, dont l'absence est notable dans les études précédentes, saturent sensiblement les facteurs d'anxiété générale et de capacité de faire face chez les répondants masculins et l'ensemble de l’échantillon respectivement. Les corrélations item-total, les coefficients alpha et les coefficients de fiabilité Spearman-Brown confirment la fiabilité de la conclusion selon laquelle ces items saturent l'ensemble de l’échelle ainsi que les deux facteurs essentiels. Ces observations réunies démontrent clairement que la PSS10 est une mesure valable d’évaluation du stress chez les étudiants en gestion de façon générale, et chez les étudiants en comptabilité en particulier. En fait, compte tenu de son efficacité sur le plan de l'administration et de la notation, la PSS10 est un instrument qui, semble-t-il, pourrait être utilisé par les gestionnaires des universités et le personnel des services des ressources humaines des organismes de comptabilité et de gestion pour évaluer les degrés de stress perçu chez les étudiants ou les employés avant que ne survienne l’épuisement professionnel, ce qui faciliterait l’élaboration plus rapide de stratégies d'intervention plus économiques.","authors":["G.

Less well understood is the temporal pattern of change in activity from one temperature to another. We acclimated fish to 22°C, and shifted the temperature such that an equilibrium was reached at 4°C after 9 hours. During the shift, we collected liver and white muscle samples and assayed homogenates for the specific activity of LDH. After three hours, LDH activity in liver increased from 22.2 µmol·min‐1·mg protein‐1to 75.1 µmol·min‐1·mg protein‐1, but then dropped by nine hours to 25.4 µmol·min‐1·mg protein‐1. Conversely, LDH activity in muscle decreased from 154 µmol·min‐1·mg protein‐1to 61.3 µmol·min‐1·mg protein‐1and continued to decrease at a slowed rate. These data demonstrate thatF. heteroclitusadjusts LDH activity extremely rapidly in response to temperature change. We are currently determining the response to the opposite temperature shift (4 to 22°C), and we plan to assess several enzymes associated with aerobic respiration and other aspects of metabolism. Together, these analyses will help us determine which major metabolic pathways are most critical to this species during rapid temperature change.\\n\\nGrant Funding Source: Supported by the Guerrieri Foundation and the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences","authors":["Amanda Biederman","E.

Our aim was to compare postexercise (PE) hemodynamics in T2D in response to four different doses of acute dynamic exercise. Two subjects with well‐controlled T2DM (42‐48 yrs; Hemoglobin A1c: 6.6 ± 0.7%) participated in four study days, during which they exercised on an upright cycle ergometer at four different combinations of exercise duration and intensity: 30 min at 40% VO2 peak(30@40), 30 min at 60% VO2 peak(30@60), 60 min at 40% VO2 peak(60@40), and 60 min at 60% VO2 peak(60@60). Heart rate, arterial pressure, and femoral blood flow (Doppler ultrasound) were measured pre‐exercise and every 15 min through 120 min PE. Femoral vascular conductance (FVC) was calculated as flow/pressure. Compared to pre‐exercise baseline, FVC was higher and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was lower throughout 120 min of recovery in all conditions, except for the 30@40 trial. Expressed as percentage change from pre‐exercise baseline, at 30 min PE, FVC was elevated 7.8 ± 1.3% on the 30@40 day, 32.3 ± 1.9% on the 30@60 day, 40.7 ± 4.6% on the 60@40 day, and 43.9 ± 9.0% on the 60@60 day. Compared to pre‐exercise baseline, at 30 min PE, MAP was reduced 0.53 ± 0.6% on the 30@40 day, 2.1 ± 2.9% on the 30@60 day, 4.2 ± 0.2% on the 60@40 day, and 6.1 ± 0.6% on the 60@60 day.

Female frogs express strong mating preferences for particular properties of male vocalizations, but how they identify individual callers within the noisy chorus environment remains unclear. One possible mechanism is cross-modal integration, whereby females attend to both acoustic and visual cues (male vocal sac inflation). In choice experiments, we used a robotic frog with an inflating vocal sac, combined with acoustic playbacks, to test the role of cross-modal integration in female tüngara frogs. In nature, male tüngara frogs produce a two-note courtship call and the vocal sac inflates synchronously during production of both notes. We tested female mating preferences when we artificially varied the temporal synchrony of the vocal sac inflation relative to the two call notes. Some combinations elicited a strong preference from females, some combinations generated a strong aversive response, and other combinations were neutral. These data show that females conduct cross-modal assessments of male callers. The temporal combinations that elicited positive, negative, or neutral responses were not predictive in a linear fashion, however, suggesting that the integration of visual cues may strongly modulate auditory perception in females.","authors":["Ryan C.

Some denial may be due to a positive self‐image that is at odds with being “at risk”. The potential for an enhanced warning message that included a positive image of a protector to circumvent this denial was tested in two studies.Methods:Optimistic denial threat orientation was measured. Then participants received either a traditional or a positive protector warning message about terrorism (Study 1; nationally representative sample of US adults;N= 587) or campus emergency preparation (Study 2; US college students;N= 179).Results:As predicted, in the enhanced image condition optimistic denial was no longer related to stronger denial reactions and lower intentions to protect oneself. In addition, Study 2 tested explanatory mediators and found that negative perceptions of and low similarity to a protector partially explained the denial of those higher in optimistic denial and why their denial was dampened in the positive image condition.Conclusions:An enhanced message including a positive image of protector may be an effective way to encourage protection for those prone to optimistic denial.","authors":["Suzanne C.

This paper proposes a method that enables a robot to classify a terrain in various outdoor environments using terrain information that it recognizes without the assistance of a user; then, it creates a three-dimensional (3D) semantic map. The proposed self-supervised learning system stores data on the appearance of the ground data using image features extracted by observing the movement of humans and vehicles while the robot is stopped. It learns about the surrounding environment using a support vector machine with the stored data, which is divided into terrains where people or vehicles have moved and other regions. This makes it possible to learn which terrain an object can travel on using a self-supervised learning and image-processing methods. Then the robot can recognize the current environment and simultaneously build a 3D map using the RGB-D iterative closest point algorithm with a RGB-D sensor (Kinect). To complete the 3D semantic map, it adds semantic terrain information to the map.","authors":["Jungwon Cho","Donghui Song","Chuho Yi"],"journal":"International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks","datePublished":"2014-4-6","aiKeywords":["autonomous robot navigation","environment perception","self-supervised learning","terrain classification","3D semantic mapping"],"facultyKeywords":["Computer and information sciences","Computer science","Electrical and computer engineering","Mechanical engineering","Engineering","Mechanical engineering, general","Electrical and electronics engineering"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/394942","licenseUrl":"http://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license"},{"id":"10.1080/21698252.2014.937556","type":"paper","title":"Asymmetrical hyperpolyglot potential in women? – Looking at linguistic chauvinism in the twenty-first century","abstract":"This article focuses on renditions of hyperglossia in a recently published popular linguistics text entitledBabel No More.The article aims to examine in detail the seemingly asymmetrical portrayal of female polyglot prowess relative to spotlighted male linguistic proficiency in the extensive diachronic and synchronic case studies presented in the text and presents historical evidence of female polyglot contributions – past and present – to fill a perceived gap in the proffered record in this widely circulating twenty-first-century text. The seeming contrast of awe for language accumulators versus doubt for actual multilingual competence in a book bearing the subtitleThe Search for the World’s Most Extraordinary Language Learnersit is argued needs discoursal scrutiny both for what is says and for its brilliant use of covert linguistic strategies to revive and reconstruct eighteenth-century accounts of global asymmetry in women’s cognitive potential 300 years later. By examining three brilliantly crafted critical discourse strategies of Underdefinition, Underreportage; and Selective Visualization, which author Erard employs to simultaneously and systematically “other,” marginalize and trivialize some multilingual speakers while privileging past and present male hyperpolyglots in particular regions of the world, we understand how global exhibitionism of power and cultural knowledge is both revived and sustained in a seemingly interconnected and deterritorialized world of “cosmopolitan” access in the twenty-first century. Eventually then, this article seeks to examine what we lose when we limit ourselves to agenda rather than the pursuit of actual historical and present-day truths with globally spanning rather than regionally oriented evidence.

These expeditions operate in regions of high biodiversity to study and protect the endemic species of these areas. New products have now made it possible to conduct molecular analyses in the field. We tested this in a volunteer-based conservation expedition to an area of tropical montane rainforest and cloud forest in Cusuco National Park, Honduras. Specifically, we (1) tested and modified recommended protocols for use of the new molecular techniques on a wide range of plant and animal species in the field, (2) tested the ability of novice volunteers to successfully use these techniques after minimal introductory training, and (3) used the novel techniques to conduct a small-scale population genetic study of Liquidambar styraciflua L. while on expedition. We found the techniques to be effective on all plant and animal species tested, with some modification of manufacturers' protocols. We also found that novice student volunteers were able to learn the required theory and protocols for the new technology, collect reliable data, and perform basic genetic analyses in a week-long DNA field sampling course. Finally, the Liquidambar case study demonstrated that genetic analyses can be successfully completed in primitive field conditions. These findings have exciting implications for work that can be done in remote locations, often areas of the greatest conservation significance.","authors":["Richard B.

To test these hypotheses, we developed a midden record from one likely refugium in north‐eastern Baja California, Mexico. We also measured stomatal guard cell size in fossil leaves to further evaluate site‐level individualistic responses ofLarrea tridentata(creosote bush) ploidy races to climatic changes, including monsoonal history, over the late Quaternary.\\n\\n## Location:\\nSierra Juárez, Lower Colorado River Basin, north‐eastern Baja California, Mexico.\\n\\n## Methods:\\nPackrat (Neotoma) middens were collected from ˂ 300 m elevation on the eastern piedmont of the Sierra Juárez. Plant macrofossils and pollen were analysed from 50 dated middens, including determination ofLarrea tridentataploidy races.\\n\\n## Results:\\nPleistocene middens dating back to > 55,000 cal. yrbpcontained a mix of extralocal species characteristic of chaparral and pinyon–juniper–oak woodland, along with some modern desert elements. Many other desert taxa were absent during the Pleistocene, although most had arrived by the beginning of the Holocene 11,700 years ago.\\n\\n## Main conclusions:\\nThe assemblage of chaparral, woodland and select desert elements refutes the hypothesis that the Lower Colorado River Basin served as a late Pleistocene refugium for Sonoran Desert flora. The rapid arrival of most missing desert species by the early Holocene suggests they did not have far to migrate. They probably survived the last glacial period as smaller, disparate populations in dry microsites within chaparral and pinyon–juniper–oak woodlands. Diploid and tetraploid races ofLarrea tridentatawere present during the Pleistocene, but hexaploids did not appear until the mid‐Holocene. This demonstrates that individualistic responses to climate involved genetic variants, in this case cytotypes, and not just species.","authors":["M. Cristina Peñalba","Jeremy L.

While standardized patient experiences (SPE) have been used widely in the educational setting when teaching about a variety of other psychiatric diagnoses, they have been used much less commonly in scenarios addressing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Using the University’s medical simulation center, nursing faculty developed an innovative learning activity for baccalaureate nursing students utilizing standardized patients with dementia. Students participated in an extended interaction involving multiple trained actors. One portrayed an individual with dementia, another was the individual’s spouse, and the third was the couple’s adult child. Standardized patient interactions were videotaped for subsequent playback and critique by students and faculty. Structured debriefing sessions were held after the interaction to further discuss any questions or concerns regarding the experience, as well as to expand upon the complexity of care-related and family issues relevant to dementia caregiving. As part of this pilot project, student participants were also asked to provide constructive feedback about the overall learning experience so as to identify strengths and areas for improvement for subsequent implementation. Student feedback was extremely positive about the value of this engaging learning activity. They noted that this exercise not only reinforced essential communication strategies needed to interact successfully with the person with dementia, but it also underscored specific interaction skills that are helpful when working with family caregivers. It is hoped that this learning activity can be modified for subsequent use by other professional dementia caregivers at area hospitals and nursing care facilities as part of a collaborative effort to extend use of the medical simulation facility for community training purposes. Further testing and evaluation of creative teaching strategies that provide hands-on training in effective communication techniques with persons with dementia and their family caregivers is essential to address the ongoing demand for expert dementia care in the US and globally.\\n\\n### Volume 10, Issue 4 S_Part_20\\nAlzheimer’s Association International Conference 2014 July 2014 Pages P732-P732\\n\\nRelated Information","authors":["Mary Christine DiBartolo","Debra A.

In order to perform discriminant analysis, we linearize a fractional programming method by using Charnes-Cooper transformation (CCT) and apply linear programming, while comparing with an approach that uses deviation variables (DV) to tackle a similar multiple criteria optimization problem. We train a discriminatory hyperplane family and make the decision based on the average of the histograms created, thereby reducing variability of predictions. Feature salience detection is performed by using the peeling method, which makes the selection based on the proportion of variance explained in the correlation matrix. While the CCT method is superior in detecting true-positives, DV method excels in finding true-negatives. The authors obtain optimal results by selecting either all 14 (CCT) or the 8 (DV) most important student study related and demographic dimensions. They also create an ensemble. A quantitative course along with the age at accession are deemed to be the most important, whereas the two courses resulting in less than 2% of failures are amongst the least important, according to peeling. A five-fold Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is undertaken, in order to help university staff in devising intervention measures.","authors":["Kristina Murtazin","Jaan Ubi","Innar Liiv","Evald Ubi"],"journal":"International Journal of Technology and Educational Marketing","datePublished":"2014-7-1","aiKeywords":["comparative analysis of predictive methods","educational assessment","student retention prediction","impact of demographics on academic performance"],"facultyKeywords":["Applied mathematics","Education research","Education research nec","Education","Educational assessment, evaluation, and research methods","Mathematics and statistics","Statistics","Applied statistics, general","Computational and applied mathematics"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/ijtem.2014070104","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.4018/978-1-4666-5888-2.ch308","type":"paper","title":"GIS and Remote Sensing in Environmental Risk Assessment and Management","abstract":"","authors":["X.

The objective of this research was to find methods to extract collagen from chicken skins and bones to compare the corresponding yield differences and analyze their properties. Collagen extracted by acetic acid, citric acid, alkali, one-step acetic acid and pepsin, and two-step acetic acid and pepsin extraction procedures was compared. Complete randomized design, Student’st-test, and Tukey’s test were used to analyze the samples(P<0.05). The recovered dry weights for the skin extractions were 6.1, 6.2, 5, 38.7, and 40.4% and those of bone extractions were 4.4, 4.1, 4.1, 19.1, and 20.6%, respectively.

Primary and secondary signal components can interact to induce novel receiver responses and become targets of sexual selection as complex signals. However, predators can also use these complex signals for prey assessment, which may limit the evolution of elaborate sexual signals. We tested whether a multimodal sexual display of the male túngara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) increases predation risk from the fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus) when compared with a unimodal display. We gave bats a choice to attack one of two frog models: a model with a vocal sac moving in synchrony with a mating call (multisensory cue), or a control model with the call but no vocal sac movement (unimodal cue). Bats preferred to attack the model associated with the multimodal display. Furthermore, we determined that bats perceive the vocal sac using echolocation rather than visual cues. Our data illustrate the costs associated with multimodal signaling and that sexual and natural selection pressures on the same trait are not always mediated through the same sensory modalities. These data are important when considering the role of environmental fluctuations on signal evolution as different sensory modalities will be differentially affected.","authors":["Kristina J.

His accounts of eight Maryland species include accurate descriptions of behaviour as well as external anatomy. His brief description of the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) may be one of the earliest accounts of this species. On the disappearance of swallows in winter, a topic of debate in the eighteenth century, Callister cited a number of reasons why he concluded that migration rather than hibernation was the explanation for this phenomenon. He noted differences in the habits of similar species in America and Europe and commented on the use of chimneys for nesting by chimney swifts (Chaetura pelagica), and the fact that some birds incorporated human-made fibres in their nests. These observations led him to conclude that, similar to humans, non-human species are capable of adapting to their environment, an idea remarkably advanced for his time. There is no evidence that Callister's dissertation reached its intended destination which may have been Reverend Dr Samuel Chandler, a Fellow of the Royal Society of London at that time. But this document demonstrates that Henry Callister was an enthusiastic and perceptive observer of nature and that he had the ability to use his observations to develop general concepts and a deeper understanding of the world around him.","authors":["Sarah A.

Influenced by the lack of clear guidelines and a recent outbreak ofSalmonellainfections that was traced back to teaching laboratory exposures, the Education Board of the American Society for Microbiology charged a task force to develop a uniform set of biosafety guidelines for working with microorganisms in the teaching laboratory. These guidelines represent best practices for safely handling microbes, based on the safety requirements found in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL). Guidelines for safely handling microbes at both biosafety level 1 (BSL1) and biosafety level 2 (BSL2) were developed.

The dolphin interacted with the system in a real echolocation task to discriminate between simulated targets that were unaltered and those that had a 180° phase shift. The frequency amplitude spectral content between the two targets was the same. There were no temporal differences between the two targets. The only cue that the dolphin could use to discriminate between them was the 180° phase shift. The dolphin preformed at a success level of 40% in discriminating the two echoes.

Co‐immunoprecipitations have shown that LRS1 forms a complex with theA. thalianahomolog of WDR20 andubiquitinbindingprotein 3 (UBP3), a USP1/12/46 homolog. To elucidate targets of the LRS1/UBP3/WDR20 complex we screened a yeast two‐hybrid expression library with LRS1 as bait. We identified ten potential interacting partners, including a zinc finger RING/ FYVE/PHD‐ domain containing protein, a leucine‐rich repeat containing protein, and a kinase involved in hormone signaling. The interaction strengths were analyzed by plating serial dilutions on selective media and β‐galactosidase assays. Ongoing experiments include expression library screening with WDR20 and UBP3 to identify additional interaction partners. This research was supported by Guerrieri and Henson Undergraduate Research programs.","authors":["Patti T. Erickson","Sean Ryan James","Floyd L.

According to these results, Rondônia contributed 3.5–4% of pantropical humid forest deforestation emissions over this period. Similar to well‐known figures reported by the Brazilian Space Agency, we found a decline in deforestation rates since 2006. However, we estimate a lesser decrease, with deforestation rates continuing at levels similar to the early 2000s. Forest carbon stocks declined at an annual rate of 1.51%; emissions from postdisturbance land use nearly equaled those of the initial deforestation events. Carbon uptake by secondary forest was negligible due to limited spatial extent and high turnover rates. Net carbon emissions represented 93% of initial forest carbon stocks, due in part to repeated slash and pasture burnings and secondary forest clearing. We analyzed potential error incurred when spatially aggregating land cover by comparing results based on coarser‐resolution (250 m) and full‐resolution land cover products. At the coarser resolution, more than 90% of deforestation and secondary forest would be unresolvable, assuming that a 50% change threshold is necessary for detection. Therefore, we strongly suggest the use of Landsat‐scale (~30m) resolution carbon monitoring in tropical regions dominated by nonmechanized, smallholder land use change.","authors":["Izaya Numata","Marcio H.

We now examine the impact of hospice services on survival in this same population. Methods: Significance (P-value) of diagnosis to death median survivals (MS) between different groups was calculated by log-rank analysis. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using Cox regression analysis. Results: 179 patients from our sample did not receive hospice services, and 211 were enrolled in hospice at some point during their illness. MS were 6.0 and 9.0 months respectively (P= 0.050, HR 1.222, CI 1.000-1.492). In the lung cancer subset, 54 patients did not receive hospice services and 78 were enrolled in hospice. MS were 5.0 and 7.0 months respectively (P=0.034, HR 1.468, CI 1.030-2.093). Other subsets were too small for analysis. Conclusions: Prolongedsurvival was significantly associated with hospice services in our sample, and that effect was more pronounced with lung cancer patients. The hospice effect on survival may reflect some combination of the following: hospice services result in better symptom management as well as counseling against toxic therapies at EOL and/or the bias of some patients against toxic treatments even before hospice enrollment.","authors":["David Eric Cowall","Veera Holdai"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","datePublished":"2013-5-20","aiKeywords":["hospice care","survival outcomes","end-of-life cancer care","rural health services"],"facultyKeywords":["Health sciences","Biological and biomedical sciences","Health sciences, other","Health sciences, general","Oncology and cancer biology","Medical clinical science","Public health","Health services research","Public health, general","Physiology, oncology and cancer biology"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/jco.2013.31.15_suppl.e20628","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1002/wrcr.20217","type":"paper","title":"Comparing multistate expected damages, option price and cumulative prospect measures for valuing flood protection","abstract":"The key choice is between non‐expected and expected utility  measures.Continuous event modeling is usefulThe basic non‐expected utility value is less than the expected utility value\\n\\nThe key choice is between non‐expected and expected utility  measures.\\n\\nContinuous event modeling is useful\\n\\nThe basic non‐expected utility value is less than the expected utility value","authors":["Scott Farrow","Michael Scott"],"journal":"Water Resources Research","datePublished":"2013-5-28","aiKeywords":["Utility measures comparison","Continuous event modeling","Risk assessment in flood protection","Decision-making processes"],"facultyKeywords":["Applied mathematics","Economics","Public policy analysis, general","Public policy analysis","Applied economics","Industrial engineering and operations research","Econometrics and quantitative economics","Operations research","Civil, environmental, and transportation engineering nec","Mathematics and statistics","Engineering","Applied mathematics, general","Applied statistics, general","Statistics","Civil, environmental, and transportation engineering","Computational and applied mathematics","Social sciences"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wrcr.20217","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1017/s1466046613000033","type":"paper","title":"Research Articles: Preparation Times for Final Environmental Impact Statements Made Available from 2007 through 2010","abstract":"## Abstract\\n\\nAnnual average environmental impact statement (EIS)-preparation times for all EIS-preparing entities combined were highly variable after 2006 and peaked in 2008 at 1,522 days (4.2 years).

Using previously overlooked archival as well as oral sources, it explores how some tigre “serfs” became increasingly proactive in challenging their subordinate position against local landlords, even as communities experienced a haphazard transition from Italian to temporary British colonial rule. Refusing to comply with the traditional payment of customary dues and taxes to local landlords, disenfranchised tigre across Eritrea’s Western Province pressed their claims for economic and even political independence. In the process, some tigre leaders also demonstrated the complex and often problematic nature of Islamic “identity” as the emancipation movement expanded. Activists’ overall success also depended upon their ability to articulate a broad, Islamicinspired understanding of the need to rectify social and economic injustice, even though such actions challenged the existing religious institutions and authorities in the region, particularly the leadership within the dominant Khatmiyya Sufi order. Ultimately, the surge in antifeudal activism helped enrich the emerging public discourse across the colony, which fused ideas of political independence with the need to ensure the collective security of the region’s various Muslim communities, including those residing beyond the country’s Tigre-speaking areas.","authors":["Joseph L.

This study provides a unique perspective of the IPO process. First, it explores the human side of a transaction in which the stakes are high for all parties involved, an issue not often discussed in other cases. Other questions raised include: On what basis does a company select its financial advisors and its global coordinator? What are the ultimate, and sometimes contradictory, objectives of the parties with regard to the pricing strategy?

Sixty 4‐ to 5‐year‐old children participated in two staged learning events. Several days later, children were asked questions that assessed their knowledge of factual information presented during the events. Children indicated whether they knew the answer to each question and whether they remembered the moment they learned it (i.e. had an episodic memory of the learning event), and then recalled event details. A majority of preschoolers were able to accurately identify how they had learned at least some factual information, but this ability was not consistent across children and test items. Recall of event‐specific details was positively correlated with correct answers to factual questions. The results indicate that when preschool children are asked to reflect on past learning experiences that occurred in complex and realistic contexts, their source monitoring abilities are evident but not yet fully developed.

This article explores two designs from her 1938 Circus Collection that were collaborations with the Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí: the Tear-Illusion Dress and the Skeleton Dress. Comparison of these designs with the work of contemporary designers Jean Paul Gaultier, Alexander McQueen and Olivier Theyskens shows the darker undertones of Schiaparelli’s Circus Collection and its significant impact on designers at the turn of the twenty-first century. These designs reassert the corporality and mortality of the clothed body and emphasize its vulnerability. Drawing on Caroline Evan’s readings of deathliness and trauma in postmodern fashion, I will examine these impulses in the work of Schiaparelli.

However, generalizations about the evolution of sex biases tend to overlook that dispersal is mediated by ecological factors that vary over time. We examined potential temporal variation in between‐ and within‐population dispersal over an 11‐year period in a bird, the dark‐eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). We measured between‐population dispersal patterns using genetic assignment indices and found yearly variation in which sex was more likely to have immigrated. When we measured within‐population spatial genetic structure and mark–recapture dispersal distances, we typically found yearly SBD patterns that mirrored between‐population dispersal, indicating common eco‐evolutionary causes despite expected differences due to the scale of dispersal. However, in years without detectable between‐population sex biases, we found genetic similarity between nearby males within our population. This suggests that, in certain circumstances, ecological pressures may act on within‐population dispersal without affecting dispersal between populations. Alternatively, current analytical tools may be better able to detect within‐population SBD. Future work will investigate potential causes of the observed temporal variation in dispersal patterns and whether they have greater effects on within‐population dispersal.","authors":["Eric B.

We first examined the timing of cell death [lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release] after a 24hr exposure to 22, 30, 37, 45, and 55°C. As expected, cells did not release LDH after 24 hrs of exposure to their acclimation temperature (22°C). At 30°C LDH release was detected beginning at 6, and all of the cells were dead by 24hrs. Exposure to 37°C, LDH released at 3hrs; all cells were dead by 6hrs. At 45°C the cells released LDH within the first hour, and were all dead by 3hrs of exposure. At 55°C the cells began to release LDH within the first 15mins, and were all dead within 1hr of exposure. mRNAs for heat shock proteins were assessed at 37°C and it was found that the constitutive heat shock protein (Hsc70) was present at all time points, and there was no significant difference in the expression of the message for the inducible form of the heat shock protein (Hsp70) over a 6 hour period.

It has been shown fish can restructure membrane phospholipids to aid in their survival in response to a change in water temperature. Biochemical evidence suggests these changes do not occur at the same time or rate. Some reactions occur rapidly, whereas others are delayed. We are currently trying to elucidate this hierarchy for mRNA expression for reactions involved in membrane restructuring. We have developed primers for many of the enzymes involved in these restructuring pathways including de novo phospholipid synthesis, in situ phospholipid modifications and phospholipid head group alterations. Our goal is to develop additional real time probes based on PCR products obtained from primers designed for enzymes in these restructuring pathways. To date, five such probes have been developed and preliminary data show that changes in mRNA expression are occurring at different rates.

Yet, to date little attention has been paid to the emergence of this reverse offshoring. This paper examines the determinants of offshoring of services from developing countries; as such the authors investigate what location factors drive these firms from developing countries to offshore services. Using data on service offshoring projects during 2001-2007 originating from developing countries, the authors found that the determinants of offshoring of services from developing countries followed similar patterns of conventional offshoring yet for different reasons. In addition, the authors also found that services offshoring from developing countries in some sectors appeared to occur because of the desire to be closer to customers.","authors":["Kraiwinee Bunyaratavej","Eugene D.

Admission to the Club is determined by a standardized interdisciplinary assessment focusing on cognitive status, problematic behaviors, and potential benefit from participation in Club activities. With permission of the family/guardian, eligible participants are escorted to this therapeutic secure environment from 11:30 am to 4:00 pm Monday through Friday for a specialized structured activities program implemented by a consistent and trained staff which consists of an activities specialist and a certified geriatric nursing assistant. At the end of the day, club staff return participants to their respective units at individualized times to ease transition to existing milieu. There is a two-week trial period upon admission to the program followed by weekly monitoring to assure participants meet the criteria of the Club. For some residents, it is an interim solution to disruptive behaviors on their home unit; for others, it is long-term placement. In rare cases, it is respite for a resident that is a victim of aggressive behavior. Discharge criteria from the Club setting include behavior that is dangerous to other residents or staff, lack of participation or benefit from therapeutic structure, and/or medical needs that cannot be met in the Club setting.\\n\\n**Results**  \\nAlthough data is preliminary, there are many documented benefits from this approach including reduced incidents of aggressive behavior and a decreased need for psychoactive medications. Other advantages include an increase in normal sleep patterns, reduced falls and hospitalizations, as well as, improvement in the overall quality of life through a more structured activities program.\\n\\n**Conclusions**  \\nNot only do the residents themselves benefit from temporary or ongoing management in this setting, but the therapeutic milieu of the facility overall is enhanced.","authors":["Amy Rebert","Stephen Vozzella","Mary DiBartolo"],"journal":"Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia","datePublished":"2012-7","aiKeywords":["Intervention strategies in long-term care","Supportive therapeutic environments","Behavioral management in cognitively impaired individuals","Enhancing quality of life for residents","Impact of structured activities on well-being"],"facultyKeywords":["Social sciences nec","Nursing specialties and practice","Health sciences, other","Mental health, counseling, and therapy services and sciences","Health policy analysis","Public health, general","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Public policy analysis, general","Public policy analysis","Sociology, general","Health services research","Health sciences, general","Public health","Social sciences","Nursing and nursing science","Health sciences","Social sciences, other","Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Sociology, demography, and population studies"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.1094","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1177/0192636512452338","type":"paper","title":"A Case of High School Hazing","abstract":"While collegiate fraternity and sorority hazing are well documented problems that receive prominent attention, hazing at the high school level is also a serious issue. Across the nation, media headlines offer a continual reminder that high school hazing is not a phenomenon of the past. As high school principals seek ways to discourage and eliminate incidents of high school hazing, it may be useful to examine a model that was implemented after a nationally covered, major hazing incident that occurred at a large Upper Midwestern high school. The case study analyzes the incident at the time and a follow-up study of the school several years later. A restorative justice program was designed and successfully implemented to address both the hazing incident and a school and community culture of acceptance and encouragement. A follow-up study conducted 7 years after the original incident suggested that the behaviors and the culture had changed.","authors":["Lori J. DeWitt","Douglas M.

Consequently, approximately 18,000 women and 7,000 men are diagnosed with HPV associated cancers yearly. Gardasil is a quadrivalent vaccine that protects against HPV strains 6, 11, 16, and 18. It is currently recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for both males and females between 11 and 26 years of age. HPV immunization rates are lower than the intended 80% goal of Healthy People 2020, with only 26.7% of the population having completed the vaccination series.

The products contain 2-amido and 7-hydroxyl substituents. A series of 2-acyl-5-aminooxazoles were prepared in one step. Upon methylation of the oxazole nitrogen atom, the substrates underwent rapid intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with a tethered alkene and, after reduction with excess hydride, produced octahydroindoles with excellent diastereoselectivity.

The network characteristics used in this study are the degree centrality and betweenness centrality. The authors find that 1) employee contextual performance is uncorrelated with the network characteristics; 2) it is significantly and positively correlated with knowledge sharing behavior, but significantly and negatively correlated with individual IT capability; and 3) task performance is correlated, both positively and negatively, with various network characteristics, but not with knowledge sharing behavior and individual IT capability.

The author provides evidence from a detailed case study of the writing of a Korean middle school student in a U.S. school setting to make a case for rethinking the efficacy of classic process‐based approaches to English to speakers of other languages (ESOL) writing pedagogy at this level. Proposing hybrid and recursive rather than linear and static methodologies based on second language acquisition research, the author calls for the use of modeling strategies to provide students with the necessary practice, conscious awareness, and eventual automaticity of key formal and functional details of writing. The article presents a visual model of writing instruction, blending graphic and acronym‐based strategies to enhance rhetorical fluency and grammatical accuracy in multifarious expository genres within and across grade levels in middle school. The article provides evidence from middle schoolESOLwriting to propose an action‐based model of bottom‐up teaching. The author argues that a detailed inductive focus on morphology, grammar, paragraph‐based discourse structure, and thesis statement construction, taught via individualized workshop configurations in theESOLwriting classroom, will in fact trigger advanced writing fluency in newcomer populations.","authors":["Anjali Pandey"],"journal":"TESOL Journal","datePublished":"2012-11-22","aiKeywords":["Rethinking traditional writing pedagogy","Modeling strategies in education","Individualized instruction in ESOL contexts","Morphology and grammar in writing instruction","Second language acquisition","Hybrid and recursive teaching methodologies","Rhetorical fluency and grammatical accuracy","Teaching practices for newcomer populations"],"facultyKeywords":["Foreign languages, literatures, and linguistics","Education research","English language and literature nec","Bilingual, multilingual, and multicultural education","Teacher education","Spanish language and literature","Humanities","Curriculum and instruction","Teacher education, specific subject areas","English language and literature, letters","Rhetoric and composition, and writing studies","Educational assessment, evaluation, and research methods","Hispanic Latin American languages, literatures, and linguistics","Education","Education research nec"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tesj.39","licenseUrl":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor"},{"id":"10.1111/jacc.12006_9","type":"paper","title":"Merchant‐Ivory Interviews.

The data show that good partnering is strongly associated with team satisfaction with budget and schedule results. The correlation among these indicators is not “proof” of the effectiveness of partnering.

The relative degree to which each signal component influences female mate choice, however, remains poorly understood. In this study we used a robotic frog with an inflating vocal sac and acoustic playbacks to document responses of female túngara frogs to unimodal signal components (acoustic and visual). We then tested female responses to a synchronous multimodal signal. Finally, we tested the influence of spatial and temporal variation between signal components for female attraction. Females failed to approach the isolated visual cue of the robotic frog and they showed a significant preference for the call over the spatially separate robotic frog. When presented with a call that was temporally synchronous with the vocal sac inflation of the robotic frog, females did not show a significant preference for this over the call alone; when presented with a call that was temporally asynchronous with vocal sac inflation of the robotic frog, females discriminated strongly against the asynchronous multimodal signal in favor of the call alone. Our data suggest that although the visual cue is neither necessary nor sufficient for attraction, it can strongly modulate mate choice if females perceive a temporal disjunction relative to the primary acoustic signal.","authors":["Barrett A.

Three cellular receptors from the progestin and AdipoQ Receptor (PAQR) family have been identified that can actively bind Acrp30: AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, located on the cell membrane; and AdipoR3 in the Golgi body. Currently, it is known that AdipoR1 and R2 allow Acrp30 to regulate fatty acid and glucose metabolism as well as cell growth and proliferation. Prior research has indicated that AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 may be involved in the Acrp30 anti‐proliferative effect but there has been minimal research on if or how AdipoR3 (PAQR3) may be involved. To determine a possible relationship between Acrp30, AdipoR3, and cell proliferation, the production of mRNA in HT‐29 human colo‐rectal cancer cells in the presence or absence of Acrp30 was quantified using quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR). These mRNA levels were also compared to the levels of AdipoR1 and R2. Briefly, the mRNA of the cell was extracted, converted to cDNA, and evaluated by qRT‐PCR using fluorescent probe primers. Following this study, RNAi knockdown experiments of AdipoR3 will be performed after which the anti‐proliferative effect of Acrp30 on HT‐29 cells will be reanalyzed. Preliminary results confirm the anti‐proliferative nature of Acrp30 and also indicate altered AdipoR3 mRNA abundance in adiponectin treated colo‐rectal cancer cells.

Low levels of Acrp 30 can lead to the onset of obesity associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Adiponectin binds to a seven transmembrane receptor, Adiponectin Receptor 1 (Adipo R1) to influence cellular energy levels. Understanding how Acrp 30 binds to and influences cellular energy levels may lead to new targets for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. To begin this determination, the importance of loop 1 and loop 2 of AdipoR1 in the physiologically relevant binding of Acrp 30 will be assessed. Loop 1 and 2 mutants were produced using Overlap Extension PCR (OEPCR). The mutated sequence was based on the corresponding region within the protein PAQR 4. This protein is a member of the same family as AdipoR1, yet it does not bind Acrp 30. Once verified by sequencing, expression of the mutant proteins and Acrp 30 downstream signaling will be analyzed to determine if either loop region is critical in protein stability and/or downstream signaling events. If either region is determined to play a role in binding by analysis of downstream signaling, future researchers could develop new medical treatments that can be used to reduce not only the risks but also the incidence of obesity. Currently, Loop 1 and 2 of Adipo R1 have been produced and are undergoing sequence analysis to ensure that the desired mutation is in place.

In a two-choice playback experiment with squirrel treefrogs, the visual stimulus of a male model significantly increased the attractivness of a relatively unattractive slow call rate. A previous study demonstrated that faster call rates are more attractive to female squirrel treefrogs, and all else being equal, models of male frogs with large body stripes are more attractive. In a similar experiment with female túngara frogs, the visual stimulus of a robotic frog failed to increase the attractiveness of a relatively unattractive call. Females also showed no preference for the distinct stripe on the robot that males commonly bear on their throat. Thus, features of conspicuous signal components such as body stripes are not universally important and signal function is likely to differ even among species with similar ecologies and communication systems. Finally, we discuss the putative information content of anuran signals and suggest that the categorization of redundant versus multiple messages may not be sufficient as a general explanation for the evolution of multimodal signaling. Instead of relying on untested assumptions concerning the information content of signals, we discuss the value of initially collecting comparative empirical data sets related to receiver responses.","authors":["Michael J.

We find that foreign aid not exceeding 20% of a country's GDP significantly promotes export diversification, while foreign aid in excess of 20% of GDP significantly impedes export diversification. The latter result corroborates evidence from related literature, which has shown that foreign aid can have an anti-export bias due to a Dutch disease effect. However, our results show that aid as a percent of GDP is below 20% in most low-income countries. This implies that in many low-income countries, varying amounts of additional aid can be used to enhance export diversification without causing a Dutch disease effect. As in the previous literature, we find that the level of development, infrastructure, transactions costs, and natural resources significantly affect export diversification. Our results are robust to the use of two different export diversification measures and different sub-samples.\\n\\n### Keywords\\n- foreign aid\\n- export diversification\\n- developing countries\\n\\n### JEL Classifications\\n- F35\\n- O35\\n\\n### Notes\\n1.

We also experimented with functional forms in which all the independent variables are in levels, but the results were not significant.\\n3.

However, little empirical research has examined the temporal dynamics (or “whens”) of services offshoring.

Employing a database of 1,420 offshore services FDI projects, we find that the relative skill level and the information sensitivity of the specific service category are associated with the temporal sequence of industry life cycle progression such that activities with decreased information sensitivity are offshored earlier than those with greater information sensitivity.

One dimension upon which variation in results may occur is the period of analysis. It is plausible that tax competiveness may change over time as the economic environment changes, and as such, an investigation into dynamic strategic tax responsiveness may be of value. We systematically examine whether, and to what extent, tax interdependencies have changed over time using a series of spatial regression models using a panel of state-level data covering U.S. states from 1978 through 2006. Results consistently provide evidence that the degree to which states change personal income tax (PIT) rates in response to changes in neighboring states diminished over much of the period of analysis. Results provide some evidence that responsiveness in setting sales tax rates also changed.","authors":["John Deskins","Brian Hill"],"journal":"Public Finance Review","datePublished":"2010-6-22","aiKeywords":["Strategic tax competition","Tax policy variation","Economic environment impact on tax policy","State-level tax responsiveness","Temporal changes in tax competitiveness"],"facultyKeywords":["Public policy analysis","Business","Business administration and management","Econometrics and quantitative economics","Economics","Public policy analysis, general","Social sciences","Business administration and management nec","Applied economics"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1091142110367856","licenseUrl":"https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license"},{"id":"10.1386/fm.1.2.9","type":"paper","title":"The New, New Wave: The French New Wave, Mumblecore, and the Idea of Aesthetic Schools","abstract":"Intellect Discover is the platform where Intellect's content lives: Browse publications for scholars and practitioners teaching and researching in the arts, media and creative industries.\\n\\nThere is no abstract available.\\n\\n\\nPreview this article:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is no abstract available.\\n\\n© Intellect\\n\\n\\nArticle\\n\\nThe New, New Wave:\\n\\nMatthew Cohen\\n\\nAffiliations:\\n1\\nSalisbury University.\\n\\nSource:\\n\\nDOI:\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1386/fm.1.2.9\\n\\nLanguage:\\nEnglish\\n\\nPublished online:\\nArticle\\n\\nKeyword(s):\\n\\n“Wake Up!” with Narrative Film Music: Optimizing Narrative Power Through Spike Lee’s Compilation Soundtracks of Popular Music\\nBy\\nMary Beth Bauermann\\npp.: 7–17\\n\\nInto the Spider-Verse and a New Age of Comic Realism\\nBy\\nSophie Barbour\\npp.: 21–33\\n\\nEditorial\\nAuthors:\\nLiza Palmer and Tim Palmer\\npp.: 4–5\\n\\nMidsommar: An Elusive Tapestry of Meaning\\nBy\\nNathan Garr\\npp.: 83–87\\n\\nGeneration Anxiety: Preface\\nBy\\nSophia Bain\\npp.: 4–6\\n\\nFrom Snow to Ice: A Study of the Progression of Disney Princesses from 1937 to 2014\\nBy\\nMaegan M.

Heart transplantation (HTx) is associated with weight gain and the frequent development of obesity. Although this weight gain has been attributed to glucocorticoid therapy, it is more dramatic than after other solid organ transplants, despite similar steroid regimens, and also unrelated to steroid dose, suggesting that other mechanisms are responsible.\\n\\nLeptin is an adipo(cyto)kine produced primarily by adipocytes that acts on the hypothalamus to decrease appetite and increases energy expenditure. Plasma leptin is thought to reflect adiposity, and obesity is associated with elevated leptin. Resistance to the appetite-suppressing effects of leptin is thought to co-exist with obesity and insulin resistance in the metabolic syndrome, but the mechanisms are poorly understood.\\n\\n## Aims\\nTo determine the relations of leptin and insulin resistance to adipose tissue mass, body composition, and caloric intake. We hypothesized that the dramatic weight gain post-HTx is associated with leptin resistance, insulin resistance, and central obesity.\\n\\n## Methods\\nWe performed a cross-sectional study in 12 HF patients awaiting HTx, 12 patients 12.7 ± 8.6 months of post-HTx, and 7 control subjects. We then performed a longitudinal study of 6 of the 12 HF patients 5.8 ± 3.3 months after HTx. Subjects were age and gender matched. The protocol complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board of Columbia University Medical Center, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.\\n\\n## Results\\nClinical characteristics and medical regimens of the cross-sectional population are summarized. Heart transplantation patients had gained 18.0 ± 7.7 kg over the 12.7 ± 8.6 months since HTx. In the cross-sectional study, HTx patients had higher BMI, fat mass, body fat %, abdominal fat mass and %, waist circumference, and leptin AUC. Despite higher fasting leptin, HTx patients had higher breakfast caloric intake than HF patients.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nIn HF patients, leptin was elevated despite normal BMI. Heart failure patients had lower caloric intake than the other groups. This may reflect inappropriately high leptin and resulting appetite suppression. The degree of insulin resistance in HF patients was high, confirming previous reports. These data suggest that leptin and insulin regulation in HF patients may be perturbed secondary to the hormonal and inflammatory aspects of HF patients rather than to obesity.\\n\\n## Limitations\\nThe small patient population is the major limitation of the study. It did not allow detection of differences between different HF aetiologies and it rendered the longitudinal findings statistically non-significant. However, the consistency of findings supports the conclusions.","authors":["John J. LaManca","Pamela Freda","Lars H. Lund","Donna M. Mancini","Jill J. Williams","Thierry H.

As individual and collective labour disputes have increased, the Chinese government has encouraged the channelling of these disputes into the mediation and arbitration process and away from street protests, spontaneous strikes, and other collective action. To date, the research on the performance of labour arbitration indicates mixed results, and is largely based on qualitative research. Consequently there is limited empirical evidence on which to assess how workers and employers rate their Labour Arbitration Bureau (LAB) dispute resolution experience. In the first study which uses quantitative survey data to explore this issue, we examine participant attitudes towards arbitration. Using a survey administered to disputants (employer and employees) in the city of Dalian, Liaoning Province, we examine the extent to which labour arbitration has met the needs of the parties. Qualitative interviews with disputants and lead arbitrators were used to triangulate survey findings. Contrary to expectations, our survey data indicate that unions were not generally involved in advocating for the rights of the employee. Nonetheless, respondents in our study reported high levels of satisfaction with the arbitration process on a range of procedural due process and substantive due process measures. Results suggest disputants were typically satisfied with the arbitration, believed that the arbitration was fair, and were willing to recommend it to others as a method for resolving labour contract disputes. Demographic data indicate that the process was also inclusive, with less educated workers, migrant workers, and women, all participating.","authors":["JINYUE SUN","E.

For routing I/O permutations of Clos networks, sequential routing algorithms are too slow, and all known parallel algorithms are not practical. We present the algorithm-hardware codesign of a unified fast parallel routing architecture called distributed pipeline routing (DPR) architecture for rearrangeable nonblocking and strictly nonblocking Clos networks. The DPR architecture uses a linear interconnection structure and processing elements that performs only shift and logic AND operations. We show that a DPR architecture can route any permutation in rearrangeable nonblocking and strictly nonblocking Clos networks in [Formula: see text] time. The same architecture can be used to carry out control of any group of connection/disconnection requests for strictly nonblocking Clos networks in [Formula: see text] time. Several speeding-up techniques are also presented. This architecture is designed for Clos-based packet and circuit switches of practical sizes.","authors":["A. GUMASTE","S. Q. ZHENG","E.

Our objectives were to: (i) evaluate the accuracy of soil sampling protocols (sampling intensity) during the growing season and after harvest, with and without manure application; and (ii) evaluate the impact of temporal and spatial variability on the accuracy of conversion equations for Mehlich‐3 to Morgan P soil test P. Two 4‐ha corn (Zea maysL.) fields were sampled (150 samples per field; 64 in a regular grid, the remainder in a pattern that optimized distribution of lag distances) in July and after corn harvest. Semivariograms were constructed to investigate spatial dependence. Simulations were done using the regular grid samples to determine the 95% confidence interval (CI) and probability of obtaining a mean within the 95% CI as impacted by sampling intensity. Thirty or more samples per 4‐ha field were needed to obtain an estimate within 10% of the population mean with >90% probability independent of the timing of sampling. Manure application reduced spatial dependence and both summer sampling and sampling within a month after manure application greatly reduced the accuracy of Mehlich‐3 to Morgan conversions used in New York (P< 0.001). Additional research is needed to expand the database with more fields, both tilled and hay and pasture fields, but based on current research, we conclude that current guidelines for the timing of sampling and number of samples per hectare should be adjusted for most accurate P guidelines, especially if Mehlich‐3 to Morgan P conversion equations are used.","authors":["Arthur J.

In-home interviews were completed with the participants at four time-points between 2005 and 2007. Path analysis was completed using longitudinal data from 286 Latino adolescents living in North Carolina and Arizona (65% foreign-born). Results indicate that acculturation stress influences family and friend relationships, which in turn affect adolescent mental health problems, and finally, substance use. Key mediators in the pathway from acculturation stress to substance use were parent–adolescent conflict, internalizing, and externalizing problems.

They also thank three anonymous referees, Brian Headd, Joe Johnson, Ying Lowrey, and Chad Moutray for helpful comments.\\n\\n## Notes\\nFor additional details see, http://www.sba.gov/advo/.  Full source information for all data used in this study, see Appendix Table A1.  Another method involves the use of contemporaneous (rather than lagged) data while instrumenting for the endogenous variable in a first-stage regression. For example, if small business activity is endogenous in the GSP regression, one would need to estimate a first-stage regression of small business activity on (1) at least one instrumental variable (IV) and (2) all of the other exogenous variables in the GSP regression. The instrumental variable would be some factor that significantly affects small business activity but that does not have an independent influence on GSP. Given the obvious difficulty with finding suitable instrumental variables, the lag structure is preferred.  The convergence hypothesis is the idea that wealthier states will grow more slowly than poorer states. The hypothesis manifests itself as a negative coefficient on the initial level of economic activity. For further explanation, see Wooldridge Citation(2001). Note that this specification implicitly controls for time-invariant state-specific factors, such as institutional differences (Acemoglu et al., Citation2005), migration patterns (Keeble and Walker, Citation1994), and the like.  Often, spillovers are modelled through the use of a spatial lag, as in the case of Acs and Plummer Citation(2005). In the present model, this would imply that state A's growth would be impacted by the growth of its neighbours. Because the authors believe the spillover is better captured in neighbouring entrepreneurial activity as opposed to neighbouring growth rates, the spatial lag approach is forgoed and a spatial cross-regressive term is instead included. These data are published by the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Specifically, year-to-year growth is calculated as the natural log of (y\\nt/y\\nt − 1). Results were nearly identical when growth was calculated as [(y\\nt – y\\nt − 1)/y\\nt − 1]. The Census defines births as establishments that have zero employment in the first quarter of the initial year and positive employment in the first quarter of the subsequent year. Similarly, deaths are establishments that have positive employment in the first quarter of the initial year and zero employment in the first quarter of the subsequent year. Small business establishment births and deaths are only available for March 1989 to March 2001, while other small business measures are available for 1988–2002. It should, therefore, be noted that births and deaths are technically lagged by 1.75 years since those data pertain to activity between March of the current year and March of the prior year. Births and deaths are preferred as being entered as two separate variables in the models such that effects of births might differ than effects of deaths. A single measure of net growth or turnover would be too restrictive in this sense. This issue will be returned to in the discussion of the results below. Without controlling for the number of large firms, the measured impact of a new small firm would not be the same as the likely impact of a new small firm. In this sense, the measured impact would not be able to distinguish between the effect of a truly new small firm and a formerly large firm that shrinks in size into the small firm category. The energy price index represents the cost of producing 1 million British thermal units (BTUs) of energy based on a weighted average of the cost of energy from different sources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear, etc., in each state. These age distribution measures are viewed as more illustrative than the mean or median of a state's population. These time-fixed effects also account for inflationary growth in the (logged) nominal variables in the models. For more discussion of these issues, see Bruce and Deskins Citation(2006) and Bruce and Gurley Citation(2005), passim. By 2001, most states had eliminated their inheritance, estate, and gift taxes. Instead, they rely on a ‘pick-up’ tax, which captures a portion of federal tax liability and does not affect the overall tax liability on the estate. For an excellent discussion of these taxes, see Conway and Rork Citation(2004). Indeed, in more restrictive models in which the two separate small firm establishment birth and death variables were replaced with a net growth measure (specifically, births minus deaths), the effect of net growth was generally positive and statistically different from zero, but very small in magnitude. This result is consistent with those in the baseline models. Full results from all robustness checks are available from the authors upon request.","authors":["Jonathan C. Rork","John A.

We monitored in fish cells the amounts of mRNA coding for some of the enzymes responsible for making these changes while the cells were exposed to reduced temperature. Chinook salmon embryo cells cultured at 20ºC were transferred to 10ºC for different times before total mRNA was extracted. Primers of our design were used to probe cDNA copies of the mRNA using PCR. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and digitally recorded. We found that mRNAs for the delta‐6 and delta‐9 desaturases were detectable at 20ºC and their quantities increased after 24 h, and again after 48 h, of cold exposure. The amount of message for glycerol‐3‐phosphate acyltransterase was low at 20ºC and remained low until it dramatically increased after 10 days at 10ºC. mRNAs for other enzymes showed other patterns of expression. Overall our data suggest that the metabolic adjustments that restructure membrane phospholipids in response to cold are activated at different times and persist for different intervals.

Cells of the B16‐F1 variant are less metastatic than those of the aggressively metastatic B16‐F10 variant. We measured the deformability of cells by assessing their ability to survive forced passage through 8 ?m apertures in polycarbonate. A higher percentage of cells of the F10 variant survived passage (67% ± 5 SEM versus 59% ± 2 SEM, n =7). Dose response curves using oleic acid (OA) and DHA (both in ethanol) revealed that, unlike OA, DHA at concentrations of 0.30 mM induced cell death in both strains. The viability of cells of both strains exposed to 0.075 mM OA or DHA for 8 h remained above 90%. After a 6 h exposure to 0.075 mM DHA the phospholipids of B16‐F1 cells contained DHA as 20% of total fatty acids compared to 6% in control cells. Cells of both melanoma variants treated with DHA in this way showed significantly reduced ability to survive passage through 8 µm apertures. The reduction was statistically equal for both strains. Cells treated with OA or ethanol showed no such change. We conclude that the incorporation of DHA into phospholipids alters the deformability of the cells and that this effect is the same in cells with high or low metastatic capacities.

The model presented combines the strength-based and person-in-environment perspectives to provide an alternative way of conceptualizing the child custody expert's design of these complicated parenting assessments.\\n\\n### KEYWORDS:\\nchild custody assessments, best interests, strength perspective, person in environment, divorce\\n\\nWhen I began thinking about writing a book about the work of child custody planning, I spent countless hours thinking about what model I would use to outline the process. After much deliberation about the innumerable theories, models, and perspectives that mental health professionals use to assess families, I was no further ahead. The decision about what model to use came to fruition when I reflected back to what the children and parents I had interviewed over the last 25 years reported about their experience with the child custody evaluation process.\\n\\nTwo responses were consistently reported. First and foremost, the majority of the children I spoke to reported to their parents that they enjoyed their appointments because I listened to them about their worries. My understanding about the feedback received from these children is that they found a person who provided them an opportunity to have an independent voice. The parents of these children consistently reported they were expecting a very negative experience, but the opposite occurred. Their perception originated from their belief that a child custody evaluator's role was to unearth and disclose all of their potential deficits and personal weaknesses. Much to the surprise of these parents, the majority of the feedback they received throughout the evaluation process had to do with an identification of their parental and personal strengths.\\n\\nI was not surprised by this feedback, as it has always been my belief that if one desired to assist people to resolve personal problems, one needed to ensure their client(s) had enough self-confidence to take the necessary risks to try new ways of being. It was this assumption that laid the foundation for the design of this dual model of practice, which combines the strength and person-in-environment perspectives. Combining these two perspectives resulted in the development of a dual model for child custody evaluators to consider when completing parenting plans postseparation.\\n\\n### THE ROOTS OF THE MODEL\\nUnderstanding that locating one's inner strength was paramount to resolving child custody problems correlated well with what Schwartz and Goldiamond (1975) coined a “strength oriented framework.” Their intent was to avoid pathologizing people by promoting a way to search for positive ways to solve problems. This practice orientation emphasizes that the client's resources, capabilities, support systems, and motivation need to be considered when completing an assessment. The thinking behind this strength-based perspective or approach to working with people is that increasing positive behaviors is the most effective way to decrease unwanted behavior.\\n\\nAs a social worker, I am no stranger to the “strength-based” approach to helping. Not only do the principles supporting the social work code of ethics fit with this way of helping (for ex: self-determination, dignity and worth of the person, integrity, competence and acceptance, etc.) this perspective finds its roots in the work of Jane Addams, who is often referred to as the founder of social work. When Addams (1902) commenced the Settlement House movement in the early 1900s, she encouraged society to “nurture a positive ideal of raising life to its highest values” (p. 32). Being aware of the need to work within a positive approach to helping placed Addams in the position of being one of the first social workers to support in principle a strength-based approach to assisting others. Another influence in selecting the strength-based approach for a component of this practice model originates from de Shazer's (1985, 1988) solution-focused practice model. His belief determined it was much more helpful to focus on solutions than problems when assisting others. de Shazer's approach to helping provides an expedient, practical way to assist separating couples who have lost the ability to co-parent.\\n\\nA message communicated by many solution-focused therapists that supports a strength-based approach to helping is that the person is not the problem; the problem is the problem. Reframing custody and access problems in this way assists to alleviate the guilt that bogs down many separating parents. Reducing this guilt provides parents with a sense of competence that helps them to leave behind the narcissistic wound so many separating couples encounter. The end result is an ability to refocus on child-focused rather than adult-focused needs.\\n\\nSupporting a positive approach when engaged in the work of child custody planning will in turn enhance the energy level of separating parents, who are often tired and worn down by the many trials and tribulations associated with their experiences with the legal system and one another. The benefactor of this resurgence of energy will most likely be the descendants of these familial systems.\\n\\n### A DUAL MODEL\\nThe strength-based perspective represents one component of the model I have chosen for outlining the child custody process. The other component satisfying this model is what has been referred to as the person-in-environment (PIE) perspective. This perspective involves assessing interactions that occur between any system and their environment that involves a reciprocal interchange of demands and resources. In regard to completing parenting plans, this means that the custody evaluator has to be cognizant of outside stressors impacting the families they deal with, like inept or unsafe neighborhoods.\\n\\nMiley, Melia, and DuBois (2004) summarize their understanding of PIE as “people affect their environments and likewise, the social and physical environments affect people” (p. 34). The key to this understanding for child custody evaluators is the need to assess parental capacity using a wide angle lens, somewhat like that utilized by a radiographer. This approach involves a broader, less linear spectrum capable of capturing any environmental influences that might be restraining a parent's abilities and capabilities to parent to their potential.\\n\\nFamily therapists are well versed in an understanding of how each member of a familial system takes part in interacting and influencing one another's behavior on many levels. The PIE perspective goes one step further by taking into account various other systems that impact one another. In social work, these systems are referred to as micro (individuals), mezzo (small groups and families), and macro (the larger community). The dual model presented takes into consideration how these various systems impact parental competence.\\n\\nIn summary, the PIE perspective provides child custody assessors with the following:\\n\\n- A common language to describe their clients' problems in social functioning.\\n- A common capsulated description of social phenomena that could facilitate treatment or amelioration of the problems in this case experienced by separating parents (Karls and Wandrei, 1994, p. 7).\\n- PIE also provides a mechanism for clearer communication among the professionals engaged in this line of work like assessors, researchers, and judicial authorities.\\n\\n### IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MODEL\\nFor a child custody evaluator, it is necessary to consider how these various systems might restrain or support a separating parent's ability to access services that are in the best interests of their children. An excellent framework to utilize in locating these supports and restraints are the following four factors that frame PIE:\\n\\n1. Social functioning problems like family, or interpersonal, occupational, and special life situation roles.\\n2. Environmental problems (including economic-basic needs, educational, legal, health, safety, social service, etc.).\\n3. Mental disorders, based on parts of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. [DSM–IV]; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), Axes I and II.\\n4. Physical health problems (Barker, 2003, p. 359).\\n\\nPIE assists child custody evaluators to draw valid and reliable conclusions about the interrelated factors that contribute to the difficulties faced by separating parents that are often beyond their control. For example, a father might decide to launch a child custody dispute because his former wife is not enrolling their children in extracurricular activities. On closer examination, the child custody evaluator might discover that the children's mother lacks transportation and the funds to pay for these activities. As child custody evaluators, we must look beyond what might appear to be parental deficits, when in reality the difficulty is related to a lack of resources based on insufficient child support and a lack of monies that restrain retaining an attorney.\\n\\nThe dual model is a practical model. The apparent need for practicality when completing child custody evaluations is lost when child custody evaluators rely solely on sophisticated theoretical models of practice that distance them from assessing daily parental responsibilities. Wiping noses, cuddling infants, and saying no to teens are practical and necessary parental activities. Assessing these functions rarely requires a complicated theoretical model of practice.\\n\\nThis does not mean the child custody evaluator negates the significance of other theoretical models when engaged in clinical practice. The person-in-environment and strength perspectives underlie the more detailed models of social work practice like attachment theory or cognitive-behavioral models that provide rich and helpful ways to assess how parents and their children are, for example, thinking and feeling. Combining these two perspectives provides a foundation for the child custody evaluator to build from when constructing parenting plans postseparation.\\n\\nTo adhere to this model, child custody evaluators will have to scrutinize their approach to practice. Miley et al. (2004) provided three key transitions mental health professionals will have to make to complete this transition:\\n\\n1. The transition from problems to challenges.\\n2. The transition from pathology to strengths.\\n3. The transition from a preoccupation with the past to an orientation toward the future (p. 81).\\n\\nThis will not be an easy transition for many mental health professionals to make. The medical model views presenting problems as pathology, which involves a diagnosis or label by the expert witness. The expert “diagnosis” also provides a rationalization for the treatment plan recommended. Mental health professionals have been using the psychoanalytic perspective and medical model since the early 1900s. These models assisted social work in particular to achieve professional status. Weick (1983, p. 467) suggests that this neat and tidy way to categorize personal problems promotes “individual fault, failure, personal inadequacy and deficiency.” My premise is that this is not always a respectful and helpful way to assist families, especially divorcing families who are already experiencing self-imposed and societal shame. Blame in my thinking blocks the potential of separating parents and restrains their ability to move forward.\\n\\nIt is also important to state that a strength-based approach does not mean child custody evaluators would ignore the many complex obstacles that separating parents bring to the child custody process, such as serious matters like mental health disturbances and domestic violence. Orienting one's view toward parental strengths merely questions the need to focus solely on pathology. It is important for child custody evaluators to be cognizant that a negative frame of reference obscures the unique capabilities of parents. Locating parental uniqueness is always in the best interests of children.\\n\\nTo summarize, child custody evaluators who decide to use this dual model would need to ascribe to the following assumptions:\\n\\n- Believe divorcing parents have a fund of resources they can withdraw from.\\n- Believe that all parents have the ability to grow and make changes throughout their separation and the child custody process.\\n- Believe that collaboration enhances the already present parental strengths and promotes learning new ways of parenting postseparation.\\n- Believe that parents know best about their family and can discover the best solutions for their family postseparation.\\n- Believe that if parents have a vision for their family postseparation, the possibilities for positive family change exist.\\n- Believe that parents can find their own solutions for the family challenges they are facing.\\n- Believe that locating parental strengths and competence is much more beneficial than locating deficits.\\n- Believe that family problems that impact parents might have to do with deficits among the numerous systems families deal with rather than solely their family system (e.g., the health care or legal systems with which they interact).\\n\\n### A Case Example\\nA child custody evaluator is asked by the courts to make a determination about a stay-at-home mother's capabilities as a parent. Her former husband is concerned that his former spouse seems to be depressed, as she is isolating herself from others. The children's father provides numerous examples of the children reporting to him that their mother is sleeping a lot in the day and they are missing activities they are accustomed to, like playing with neighborhood children at their neighborhood park. During the course of the evaluation, the child custody evaluator receives the following information from the children's mother.\\n\\nHer spouse left her 3 months prior with little warning with three children under the age of 10. She has recently discovered that the reason for the separation was driven by the fact her husband had been engaged in an extramarital affair with a woman he worked with for 2 years who is 20 years younger than she or her former spouse. This mother further reports giving up a professional career 10 years prior to satisfy the role of a stay-at-home mother. She is experiencing stress and worry as her former spouse expects her to imminently return to work because she has a university education. Enhancing her stress level is the fact her extended family blames her for the separation as she has not looked after herself physically since having the third child, who is now 2 years of age. Consequently she has no support system when she requires one more than ever.\\n\\nAccording to the mother's physician with whom the child custody evaluator confers, his patient is not experiencing a clinical depression. The physician interviewed is of the opinion his patient is understandably worried about her familial situation. He has prescribed a low dosage of a sleeping pill to stabilize his patient's sleep. When pushed by the child custody evaluator for a diagnosis, the physician states his patient is a wonderful mother and her present state of being is based on the many restraints she is experiencing. He refers to his patient as experiencing a reactionary depression based on the lack of a support system.\\n\\nThe child custody evaluator assessing this situation has two choices. One choice is to assess using a linear and judgmental approach similar to the process involved when one adheres to a rigid use of the medical model. This approach involves the selection of a diagnosis or label supported by the DSM–IV. In this case the woman would quite likely be labeled depressed. This approach will do nothing other than to lock this woman into a negative mindset that will not be in the best interests of her children. The other choice is to point out throughout the evaluation process the environmental stressors this woman is enduring based on the lack of a support system.\\n\\nHistorically this woman has been described by collaterals as an excellent parent. Collaterals refers to personal references or professionals involved with the family, like school teachers, counselors, and so on. It is important to provide positive feedback received from collaterals to divorcing parents. The strength-based approach supports the significance of relaying positive parental attributes to separating parents.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to assess using a supportive process, not one that adds stress to an already stressful situation. When one combines the PIE and strength perspectives, assessors collect data that encompass the whole picture that separating parents endure. This approach to assessment is much more in line with what is in the best interests of children.\\n\\nTo summarize, when parents experience a separation they still need to partake in everyday activities like buying groceries, preparing meals, and bathing their children. When these transactions are possible, the energy level of the family remains positive. This in turn enhances parental abilities to engage in transactions within their community, like taking children to extracurricular activities or medical appointments. Unfortunately when parents experience separation and require the assistance of mental health professionals like child custody evaluators they often do not have the energy to demonstrate they can parent to the best of their abilities. It is important for child custody evaluators to keep in mind that a parent's internal life does not operate on its own. One's interaction with environmental events is constant. The intersection between these two worlds is the place where the child custody evaluator observes parental behavior. Being aware of these intersections is significant when collecting assessment data.\\n\\nJohnson and Yanca (2001) caution mental health professionals to be cognizant of the fact that these transactions encompass interactions that are embedded in and influenced by other interactions and situations. In regards to child custody matters, the behavior a child custody evaluator observes might be situational and based on systemic difficulties and stressors that do not represent the normal parental capabilities of the parent being observed. As children only experience one childhood, it is important for child custody evaluators to locate the truth about familial dynamics and parental capabilities. Consideration of environmental stressors is key to collecting reliable and valid data. Combining the strengths-based and PIE perspectives promotes this understanding. Ultimately an understanding of the stressors parents face at this difficult time assists to ensure child custody evaluators understand the reality of the daily lives these parents are experiencing. A clinical tool often utilized by social workers called the ecomap enhances this understanding (see Appendix).\\n\\n### The Ecomap: An Assessment Tool\\nThe ecomap provides a visual snapshot of the social functioning, environmental factors, and embedded influences impacting separating parents, in this case. As an assessment tool, the ecomap provides an overview of the positive and restraining factors that impact individual and familial functioning. It also shifts emphasis from the past to the current functioning of the family. Focusing on the present and future is significant in moving divorcing families forward.\\n\\nThe specific purpose of the ecomap is to depict the family members' contact with other social systems much larger than themselves. Hartman (1978) notes:\\n\\n> The ecomap portrays an overview of the family in their situation; it pictures the important nurturant or conflict-laden connections between the family and the world. It demonstrates the flow of resources, or the lack of and deprivations. This mapping procedure highlights the nature of the interfaces and points to conflicts to be mediated, bridges to be built, and resources to be sought and mobilized. (p. 467)\\n\\nWhen implemented as a diagnostic tool, the ecomap often adds clarity to the many complex issues separating families face. For example in the case cited prior, an ecomap would provide an understanding of the many restraints this mother was facing. Specifically, her relationships were strained because of the physical and emotional exhaustion she was expected to endure throughout the crisis stage of her separation. Her state of exhaustion was promoting social isolation during a period of her life when she required support from her extended family and friends. The support was not forthcoming because of the judgmental stance her parents in particular had taken. The ecomap would demonstrate quite clearly that the family physician was a strong, positive, and supportive relationship for this mother.\\n\\nThe usefulness of this tool has been supported by Mattaini (1989), who reported that students who used ecomapping paid more attention to higher level systems than did students who did not use it. Wright and Leahey (2005) also support the use of this tool in numerous health care settings. Their book, Nurses and Families: A Guide to Family Assessment and Intervention, provides a detailed description of how to use the ecomap.\\n\\nIn completing a parenting assessment, the ecomap increases the awareness of the child custody evaluator's consideration of the whole family and their interactions with larger systems. This tool also enhances the clarity and helpfulness of one's assessments when combined with both the PIE and strengths perspectives. As an assessment tool, the ecomap is an excellent fit when used with the dual model prescribed.\\n\\nOthers have written about these two perspectives that satisfy the dual model. Saleeby (1992) supports combining these two perspectives because the strengths perspective focuses on one's ability to self-assess and interact with one's environment. Bartlett (1970) also supports the use of these two perspectives. She writes, “people coping with life situations balance between demands of the social environment and people's coping efforts” (p. 130). A third reason for selecting to combine these two perspectives as a dual model of practice is that they provide a practical, holistic, and positive approach when considering parental capacity.\\n\\n### CONCLUDING COMMENTS\\nThis article has attempted to put forward a model of practice that might be of assistance to child custody evaluators engaged in the work of designing parenting plans postseparation who are looking for a positive, less intrusive way to assist families. Another benefit associated with the use of this model is eliminating the need for extensive litigation that often leaves separating parents in debt and dissatisfied with the child custody process.\\n\\nMy experience indicates that using this approach to evaluating families helps alleviate the need for court trials. Of the 322 expert reports I have completed, 97% have been settled without the need for a lengthy, expensive, and emotionally draining court trial. Parental satisfaction might even prevent malpractice complaints, which are the dread of the mental health practitioners who engage in this line of work. The intensity involved in all of these activities directed to locating the “whodunit” mentality can thwart the best of attempts at planning for children whose parents engage in child custody battles. The model presented is an alternative way to locate some sense of peace and harmony in families desperate for a new direction or path to follow.","authors":["Margo Anne Kushner"],"journal":"Journal of Divorce &amp; Remarriage","datePublished":"2009-6-16","aiKeywords":["Ecomap as a tool for assessing familial dynamics","Dual model of practice for child custody evaluations","Impact of environmental factors on parenting","Person-in-environment perspective","Child custody assessment methodologies","Parental strengths and capabilities","Strength-based perspective","Reducing litigation in custody disputes","Social work theory in child custody evaluations","Positive vs. negative experiences in custody evaluations"],"facultyKeywords":["Sociology, demography, and population studies nec","Nursing and nursing science","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies nec","Health services research","Public health, general","Marriage and family therapy counseling","Nursing specialties and practice","Sociology, general","Public health","Social sciences","Nursing science","Area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies","Health sciences","Rehabilitation and therapeutic sciences","Health sciences, other","Mental health, counseling, and therapy services and sciences","Sociology, demography, and population studies"],"downloadUrl":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10502550902766423","licenseUrl":""},{"id":"10.1080/19312430903065300","type":"paper","title":"Technological Migrants and Technological Natives: Classroom Dynamics When Teacher/Student Roles are Reversed","abstract":"Restricted access\\nResearch article\\nFirst published online July 1, 2009\\nTechnological Migrants and Technological Natives: Classroom Dynamics When Teacher/Student Roles are Reversed\\nDavid Burns davidburns20@yahoo.com\\nView all authors and affiliations\\nVolume 3, Issue 3\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/19312430903065300\\nContents\\nGet access\\nMore\\nCite article\\nShare options\\nInformation, rights and permissions\\nMetrics and citations\\nGet full access to this article\\nView all access and purchase options for this article.\\nGet Access\\nCite article\\nCite article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Cite article\\n          \\n\\n\\nCopy Citation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOR\\n\\n\\nDownload to reference manager\\nIf you have citation software installed, you can download article citation data to the citation manager of your choice\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect your citation manager software:\\n\\n(select option)\\nRIS (ProCite, Reference Manager)\\nEndNote\\nBibTex\\nMedlars\\nRefWorks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDirect import\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare options\\nShare\\nShare this article\\nShare with email\\nEmail Article Link\\nShare on social media\\nFacebook\\nX (formerly Twitter)\\nLinkedIn\\nWeChat\\nShare access to this article\\nSharing links are not relevant where the article is open access and not available if you do not have a subscription.\\nFor more information view the  Sage Journals article sharing\\n  page.\\nInformation, rights and permissions\\nInformation\\nAuthors\\nInformation\\nPublished In\\nElectronic News\\nVolume 3, Issue 3\\nPages: 118 - 120\\nArticle first published online: July 1, 2009\\nIssue published: July 2009\\nRights and permissions\\n© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\\nAuthors\\nShow all\\nDavid Burns\\nSalisbury University\\ndavidburns20@yahoo.com\\nView all articles by this author\\nNotes\\nCorrespondence should be addressed to David Burns, Assistant Professor, Department of Communication Arts, Fulton Hall 262, Salisbury University, Salisbury, MD 21801.

Ghrelin is a novel appetite‐stimulating hormone. The aim was to determine the role of ghrelin in regulating appetite, food intake, and body composition in HF and post‐HTx.\\n\\n## Methods and results:\\nWe measured serial ghrelin, hunger sensation, caloric intake, and body composition in 12 HF patients awaiting HTx, 12 patients 12.7 ± 8.6 months post‐HTx, and 7 controls. Seven of 12 HF patients were followed for longitudinal analysis post‐HTx. Body mass index was 23.1 ± 3.1 in HF and 31.5 ± 5.5 post‐HTx (P< 0.001). Heart transplantation patients had gained 18.0 ± 7.7 kg since HTx. Ghrelin area under the curve between controlled meals (control: 186 ± 39; HF: 264 ± 71; HTx: 194 ± 47 ng min/mL,P< 0.007) was higher in HF, but test meal caloric intake (control: 1185 ± 650; HF: 391 ± 103; HTx: 831 ± 309 kcal,P< 0.008) was lower in HF. The longitudinal analysis confirmed these findings.\\n\\n## Conclusion:\\nHeart failure may be associated with resistance to the appetite‐stimulating effects of ghrelin, which may contribute to cachexia. Heart transplantation may be associated with resolution of ghrelin resistance, which may contribute to weight gain. These findings are preliminary and should be confirmed in larger trials.","authors":["John J. LaManca","Pamela Freda","Lars H. Lund","Donna M. Mancini","Jill J. Williams","Thierry H.

In addition, IT represents a large (40--45%) and stable share (in nominal dollars) of firm spending on equipment and software. As CIOs and IT managers attempt to budget these large IT expenditures they must help the business align IT spending with business strategy and prioritize IT investments in conjunction with business goals. When prioritizing IT spending managers often compare their own IT spending priorities with those of other firms. That is,\\n\\n\\"Every year, CIOs and their finance people get prepared for the following question from their CEOs: \\"How does our IT spending compare with our competitors?\\"\\n\\nIn an effort to help firms benchmark their IT spending priorities, we surveyed 1,495 business leaders in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, and Texas during the 4thQuarter of 2005 to examine the firms' IT spending priorities across business functions (such as, administration; production and distribution; customer relationship management; research and design; managerial decision-making; and security) and the impact of firm and industry characteristics on these priorities. While previous studies examine IT spending from different perspectives, we are not aware of any work that examines the factors that determine how firms allocate IT expenditures across business functions.\\n\\nEmpirical analysis of this survey data shows that the highest IT spending priorities of the respondents are in the areas of administration and production and distribution while the lowest priorities are in the areas of research and development (R&D) and security. In addition, the analysis shows that factors such as industry type, firm size, and perceptions of the impact of past IT investments on product quality and revenue may differentially affect the allocation of IT expenditures across business function categories. For example, the results show that:\\n\\n• Service firms are more likely to rank IT spending in support ofR&Dandsecurityas their highest priority.\\n\\n• Small firms are more likely to rank IT spending in support ofsecurityas their lowest priority.\\n\\n• Firms that have leveraged past IT expenditures to increase product/servicequalityare more likely to rankcustomer relationship management (CRM)as their highest IT priority.\\n\\n• Firms that have leveraged past IT expenditures to increaserevenuesare more likely to rankmanagerial decision-makingas their highest IT priority.","authors":["Hoon S.

Stewart, Jianping Hu, Robert E. Kayen, Arthur J. Lembo Jr., Brian D. Collins, Craig A. Davis, and Thomas D. O’Rourke\\n\\n**Publication**: Journal of Surveying Engineering\\n**Volume**: 135, **Issue**: 3\\n**Date**: August 2009\\n\\n**Abstract**: We investigate the use of multiepoch airborne and terrestrial lidar to detect and measure ground displacements of sufficient magnitude to damage buried pipelines and other water system facilities that might result, for example, from earthquake or rainfall-induced landslides. Lidar scans are performed at three sites with coincident measurements by total station surveying. Relative horizontal accuracy is evaluated by measurements of lateral dimensions of well defined objects such as buildings and tanks; we find misfits ranging from approximately 5 to 12 cm, which is consistent with previous work. The bias and dispersion of lidar elevation measurements, relative to total station surveying, is assessed at two sites: (1) a power plant site (PP2) with vegetated steeply sloping terrain; and (2) a relatively flat and unvegetated site before and after trenching operations were performed. At PP2, airborne lidar showed minimal elevation bias and a standard deviation of approximately 70 cm, whereas terrestrial lidar did not produce useful results due to beam divergence issues and inadequate sampling of the study region. At the trench site, airborne lidar showed minimal elevation bias and reduced standard deviation relative to PP2 (6–20 cm), whereas terrestrial lidar was nearly unbiased with very low dispersion (4–6 cm). Pre- and posttrench bias-adjusted normalized residuals showed minimal to negligible correlation, but elevation change was affected by relative bias between epochs. The mean of elevation change bias essentially matches the difference in means of pre- and posttrench elevation bias, whereas elevation change standard deviation is sensitive to the dispersion of individual epoch elevations and their correlation coefficient. The observed lidar bias and standard deviations enable reliable detection of damaging ground displacements for some pipelines types (e.g., welded steel) but not all (e.g., concrete with unwelded, mortared joints).","authors":["Arthur J.

This information is then used to determine a firm's optimal rate of information technology (IT) outsourcing. We find that the optimal outsourcing rate is dependent on the ability of the outsourcing client to acquire production knowledge from its outsourcing vendor and to retain its internal coordination knowledge despite losses of fundamental production skills due to outsourcing. Specifically, when the client is unable to acquire sufficient production knowledge from the external vendor, the client's optimal outsourcing decision is to engage in either one of two extreme strategies—total insourcing or total outsourcing—depending on the rate at which the client's coordination knowledge depreciates. On the other hand, when the client is able to acquire a substantial amount of production knowledge from the external vendor, the firm's optimal decision is to outsource only a portion of its IT services, where the proportion depends on the rate at which the client's coordination knowledge depreciates.\\n\\n**Keywords:** coordination, economic analysis, IT outsourcing, knowledge, modeling, organizational learning, outsourcing, production costs, vendor-client relationship","authors":["Hoon S.

Our objective was to develop a methodological framework to study spatially explicit environmental and meteorological factors affecting the probability of pathogen isolation from a location. Isolation ofListeriaspp. from the natural environment was used as a model system. Logistic regression and classification tree methods were applied, and their predictive performances were compared. Analyses revealed that precipitation and occurrence of alternating freezing and thawing temperatures prior to sample collection, loam soil, water storage to a soil depth of 50 cm, slope gradient, and cardinal direction to the north are key predictors for isolation ofListeriaspp. from a spatial location. Different combinations of factors affected the probability of isolation ofListeriaspp. from the soil, vegetation, and water layers of a location, indicating that the three layers represent different ecological niches forListeriaspp. The predictive power of classification trees was comparable to that of logistic regression. However, the former were easier to interpret, making them more appealing for field applications. Our study demonstrates how the analysis of a pathogen's spatial distribution improves understanding of the predictors of the pathogen's presence in a particular location and could be used to propose novel control strategies to reduce human and animal environmental exposure.","authors":["B.

Results from a series of fixed-effects regressions using a 1992-2002 panel of state-level data indicate that increased spending on higher education generally exhibits a relatively large negative effect on private sector employment or gross state product growth when the increase in education spending is financed through own-source revenue. Results do not identify a statistically significant relationship between K-12 education spending and economic growth. This finding is an important clarification in the literature because an analysis of combined higher and K-12 education spending yields an overall negative effect.

This provides the students the opportunity to connect history with physical places that they can visit and experience.
